I asked him what a nerve's rest period was before it can signal again, and if a nerve can handle more than one signal simultaneously.  He told me that most nerves can handle many signals in both directions each way, depending on how many were bundled together.

This got me thinking, given some rough parameters on the speed of signal and how many times the nerve can fire in a second, can the bandwidth of the spinal cord be calculated and expressed as Mb/s?",How much bandwidth does the spinal cord have?

We are a couple weeks out from full term on no. 3 and I feel so different from no. 1!  Quite a lot different from no. 2 also.  All I can remember from no. 1 was an all consuming anticipation - how will my life change?  what is it like to be a father?  how the eff do I care for this kid?  Then I remember no. 2 - how can this compare to the emotion of no. 1?  will I love this kiddo as much as my all consuming love for the first one?  then later, surprise at falling just as much in love with no. 2 as no. 1.

As I wait for no. 3, I feel the same as with 2.  I can't comprehend loving 3 little ones as much as I love the 2 I already have, but still expect it to somehow happen. I'm still dealing with no. 3 and last (for now) being another girl (3 for 3 :-)) but at the same time, this one feels less real than the other two.  I still can't believe it's happening.  This is some real stream of consciousness shit at 11pm, but I don't know where else to spill it.  Being a dad is the best part of my life and I still feel undeserving.

**tl:dr:  Made a verbal agreement to buy vehicle contingent on inspection after detailing, dealer stops by office to grab a ride back on way to mechanic, sells car to someone else. Wastes 5 days of my time.**

I've been on the hunt for a use minivan for my family for about two weeks now.  I figured out exactly what our budget is, and after test driving a bunch of things we figured out exactly what we want, my area doesn't have a lot of the specific vehicle we are looking for, so I've branched out to everywhere I can fly to and drive back in under 3 days.

I found a great van in Minnesota, and spent a few days talking to the dealer, we got very close on price and I was liking everything about the car, so I told him I would buy it for $14,500 as soon as I had it inspected by my mechanic.  This is last Thursday and the car has just gone out for detailing (they took it in on trade last Monday or so).  So I find a good mechanic in the area and work out a deal with him for an inspection and test drive on my behalf.   The salesperson agrees to take the car to the mechanic when it comes back from detailing.  I'm hoping that he can get it done Friday morning and I can fly out that afternoon and drive back Saturday.   Friday the car doesn't come back from detail and sales tells me, ""Monday morning.""  Fine.  At least it won't sell Saturday in the weekend rush.

Monday morning (yesterday) I call.  ""It's not back yet, do you want me to get it out of detail so he can look at it before they're done?""  Me: ""Its fine, just please let me know as soon as it's back so I can let the mechanic know when to expect you.""  Later that day... ""It won't be back until tomorrow, I'll call you first thing.""

This morning I call the dealership. ""It's done at detail, I can bring it to the mechanic at noon.""  So I call my mechanic, pay him, tell him car will be there at noon.  11:45am text from sales: ""Got the van now, taking it to mechanic.""

1pm: Nothing

2pm: Nothing

2:30pm: I call the mechanic, ""They never brought it in.""  

Me: ""WTF?"" So I call dealer, ""Hey, the mechanic has been waiting for you two hours, what's going on?""

Sales: ""Well, I brought the car back to the dealership to get another salesman to follow me to mechanics and someone else sold it while it was parked outside.""

Me: ""You're fucking kidding me?""

Sales: ""I'm sorry.""

Me: ""You're fucking kidding me!""

Sales:  ""Someone came in, saw it outside, asked for a test drive, it was gone when I came out and he came back and bought it.""

Me: ""Your sales manager knew we had a deal arranged 4 fucking days ago right?  I'm not the one who's been fucking around all weekend.""

Sales:  ""He had bad credit and sales made a better financing deal with him.""

Me: ""Thanks for wasting my fucking time.""

Sales: ""Sorry.""

Me:  ""FFS.""

Absolutely fucking livid, there are like 20 cars in the country fitting my criteria and budget and I wasted a week on these asshats.  It's like I'm going to buy a car from across country without an inspection.  So frustrated.  ",[Rant] My car search is really sucking

However, in the past 6 weeks I have had two dental emergencies, and I'm still waiting for my dentist to see me for either.

Last month my last uncrowned molar, #19, had a filling pop out, no biggie, it's due to be crowned.

They first available was Aug 8th, 7 full weeks away.  As long as its not dangerous though, I'm okay with it, but it is a real annoyance, can't chew on that side, hard to clean out, etc.

Fast forward to 10 days ago and my upper left biscuspid, #12 cracks suddenly while eating pizza.

I'm 99% sure he's just sold something at 10-20% higher than I did and is asking me to ship my item to his buyer, which rubs me the wrong way but I guess I'm okay with it.

I think today's race struck me as one that belongs on the list.  Coming in to the weekend I wasn't really sure if Ferrari could still be on the pace after Mercedes impressive upgrade package, and honestly I was most excited for RBR, hoping they could close the gap, but that 1-2 race was exciting stuff.  Were it not for Seb overbraking himself overtaking Massa we might have seen some wheel to wheel action on the last lap for the win, and it really would have been in the ultimate list of must see F1 Races.

Even lacking that, the race stands as the best this season, hands down.  Two passes for the lead, differentiation in the tyre strategies, multiple retirements.  I feel like in the season wrap for 2017 we will look back at Spain as the starting point of a classic WDC struggle.

I do model building and board games as a hobby, and often times when trying to find popular board games or models, the prices on Amazon and ebay will be much higher than MSRP due to demand. 

In most cases I have found that the manufacturers website will sell them to you at the msrp or below, even when they are out of stock elsewhere. Even if the website does not do sales, you can email them and they may have some for sale.  In a few cases, I have been able to make a profit by getting two out of print games, and selling the second one at the going rate.

Always check multiple sources before buying!",Some hobby items can be cheaper directly from the publisher/manufacturer

Anyway this is my first model in 20 years, tho I have been doing watchmaking/repair and miniatures painting quite a lot in the last 10 years and a lot of those skills are still in my repertoire.

Anyway, after receiving this Airfix kit I decided the lack of detail was criminal and I bought some 3rd party, custom cast styrene pieces, specifically the 5 F-1 engines and the thrust structures for the S-II and S-IVB stages.

I am at the point of assembling the engines and thrust structures, and while the piece supplied by Airfix include little 2 or 3mm pegs to insert into the thrust structures they provide, these custom cast pieces do not.  I doubt model cement is enough to withstand the lateral strain if I just bond them, so I am planning on drilling 2 or 3mm holes to a depth of 3mm and using 2mmx6mm or 3mmx6mm dowels to strengthen the connections.

I have never done this sort of custom modelling before and I don't really know anything about working in styrene.  Is this sort of connection adequate?  Is it way too much?  What is the typical solution to this sort of problem.  Thanks to an awesome community for your help.",Need advice re: connections

I love the game, but I would really like it if we could add some difficulty and challenge to staying on top.

One thing I would like to see is a much greater risk/reward part at the top of the top series.  I think this could be done by having a distinction between works and customer teams.  Customer teams could still choose an engine manufacturer at the start of each season, or every 1-3 season (long term contracts in the game would be awesome!).  

At a certain point in the top tier you could spend money to become a works team, where you can do long term R&D and innovations.  For works teams, engines are now power units and the components can be developed separately. Innovations for PU parts could give your team a great boon, but they would also come at the cost of a hidden reliability score.  So yeah, your new turbocharger might provide an extra 150bhp but maybe it suddenly goes out or causes your engine reliability to drop 30% if it fails during a race.

The other thing I would love to see is regulation resets in the F1 series.  Every 3-5 years, new regulations force everyone to ditch their existing cars and is reset to common value so that the development arms race can resume again.

As it is, I typically can take a team from ERS to world champions in about 5 years, with most of that spent getting out of ERS.  By the time I've developed my campus enough to get our of ERS, I usually spend no more than 1 or 2 years in Asia before going to the top, and my last two campaigns I've won the top tier in my first season.

I would love to be able to settle into a long campaign with an F1 mod, but being miles ahead of the top teams by year 2 and 3 really makes that anti-climactic.  I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on ways to keep the late game interesting.",Ideas to increase difficulty at the top

For the last two console cycles I did most of my gaming on PC, but continued to buy the Wii and Wii U and the 3DS to play Nintendo's first party games.  All that said, I don't think I'll be buying a switch and I think I've actually reached the point where I wish that Nintendo was just a games company and not a hardware company.

Starting with the N64 (which may be my favorite console ever) Nintendo stopped competing with the field on gameplay and started trying to 1up everyone on gimmick hardware (N64 Controllers, Gamecube discs and controllers, Wii's motion controls, Wii U's second screen, Switch's portability).  I have had my Wii U for almost 3 years, and aside from the occasional Mario Kart, I played Wind Waker HD and Mario World 3D and that was it.  Looking down the cannon of buying a switch now for Mario and Zelda again and I just don't think I can do it anymore.  I can't justify spending $300 on a console so I can play 1-2 games per year for a couple of years.

I hate to say it but I think I would be happier if Nintendo left the hardware market and started making Mario and Zelda games across all the platforms.  Think of how much money they could be making, with an install base of 100 millions across the other consoles and PC vs the relatively small install base of Wii U and Switch.

To me, government control and/or regulation is going to lead to UK style thought police and censorship.  Isn't this matter better handled in the free market?

Developed pain 4 1/2 years ago.  Psoriasis soon followed.  Went to Rhuematologist and was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis.  Prescribed Humira (I think).  Did a couple injections but didn't like it (it hurt).  Also didn't care for the Rheumatologist.  I stopped with the injections, went vegan for 4-5 months and my pain symptoms seemed to have went into remission (or at least downgraded to manageable).

Flash forward to now and the pain is getting worse.  I have an appointment to see a new Rheumatologist at the end of the month.  Saw the dermatologist a week ago to get new psoriasis meds.  Told him about my pain and the rheumatologist and he offered to go ahead and get me started with Stelara to treat the arthritis.

The pain is getting bad.  I want to get treatment but am unsure of going with the dermatologist's recommendation or waiting for the Rheumatologist's opinion.  Also, has anybody been on Stelara and care to share their experiences?

I had been eying this one for quite some time so I figured might as well jump in and so what all the fuss is about.

Since I was new the plan was for me to be USSR because I guess they have a slight early-game advantage.  Somehow I sat down on USA's side and got started with them.  Oh well.  We went through the rules which seemed simple enough aside from the Coup's which I'm not sure I entirely understand.

It became a battle of back and forth.  I established early leads in South East Asia while USSR gained influence in the Middle East.  With no end game in sight we proceeding to the next turn where I believe I got dealt three scoring cards.  Unfortunately this was not the last time I had three scoring cards in my hand.  I was able to make a few points off of South East Asia and eventually a few in Asia proper.  We proceeding to mid game.

USSR made a quick coup of South Africa and expanded quickly across the Serengeti.  I was able to prevent an all out control with my quick expansion into Algeria from my holdings in Egypt.  Unfortunately he was able to score Africa for domination points and most of the battleground states.

Next turn I soon began to toss down influence in South and Central America.  I was unstoppable.  Then the worst happened.  USSR played the card that gave him Cuba (don't remember the name).  Slowly he expanded into most of central america.  A scoring card came up.  It was a wash.  I quickly secured my holdings in South America while he focussed on Asia.  A scoring card for Asia was soon played.  He had control of most of Asia, Central America, Africa, and was quickly expanding into South America.  The writing was on the wall for the USA.

We entered late game.  Everything was a blur for the US during the Reagan years.  If the USA was to pull it off, a gamble would have to be made.  Europe was ripe for the taking.  In the early game the US had lost influence in France and West Germany while the USSR had gained control of Italy.  They now controlled East Germany, Poland, and had influence in all the other battleground states.  It was risky.  It was my only chance.

I had Chernobyl. I had the China card.  I had hope.

Quietly I retook France and secured other non-battlground states I had lost in Europe.  He was too focused on South America and Asia.  Then it happened. Chernobyl.  He couldn't exert influence in Europe.  We were at Defcon 3.  No Coup's or realignments either.  The rest of the turn I ignored his dealings.  I played Solidarity and gained Poland to my side.  I was able to take East Germany as well as Italy.  I had all the battleground States.  It was total control.  I however, did not have the Europe scoring card.

The final turn.  Sequence 10.  End game.  Our hands were dealt.  European scoring card was in the USA's control.  It was only a matter of time . . . 

Adrich Ames remix was the USSR's headline card.  I had to turn up my cards and he got to discard one of mine. I don't remember what card it was.  He saw I had European scoring.  He played Pershing II Deployed on his turn.  I lost influence in West Europe.  He regained Poland and East Germany.  I was able to get East Germany back.  It didn't matter. Poland was theirs (his). 

The game ended.  He won with 19 points I believe.  It took six hours to play my first game of Twilight Struggle.  I was hoarse when all was said and done.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants great picture quality in the $1500 budget but who can't find the ST60.  So, what is the next best thing for that price range and size?  

They showed me the only other 60"" plasma in stock: the Samsung 5300, but I wasn't sure about that one.  I don't have to have Plasma but I figured the best PQ would be Plasma.  I also don't have to have 3D, but it would be fun to have when Gravity comes out. I just want something that will make Lawrence of Arabia look amazing in my living room.

I posted my Criterions to /r/criterion yesterday and my Disney's were noticed and got some love so I decided to show the whole thing here.  I don't frequent /r/dvdcollection anymore because I was spending too much on blu-rays.  Still, its a great community and I like to visit every so often.

So without further adieu . . . 

[My Collection](http://imgur.com/a/XYQIS)

1. Hailing from Norman, Oklahoma, USA

2. Birthday would be in a month and two days: December 9

3. Favorite Genre is tough. I just love good and/or entertaining films. I think my collection reflects that. Aside from Musicals and Anime I have a little bit of everything.  I guess my least favorite genre would be horror.

4. My very first DVD I bought was the Terminator 2: Judgment Day steel sleeved edition--I believe that was the Ultimate edition..  I got a DVD player for christmas that year and had to go find a DVD to buy, this was the one.  Braveheart was my 2nd.  I think this was Christmas of 2000 and I remember looking at dvd.ign.com at reviews for hours trying to pick the best DVD to showcase the quality of the medium.

5. Guilty pleasure movie? Hard to say. Probably something that really isn't a good film but I still find entertaining. Looking at my collection ""A Night at the Roxbury"" fits that bill.

6. Least favorite movie I own? The Passion of the Christ.  I was a different person when I bought it.  It's pure torture-porn.  It's sick.  But you never know when you might want to throw it on for irony or disgust purposes.  Plus I'll need it for the eventual Salo/Passion torture porn double feature!

7. My favorite director for a long time has been Christopher Nolan, mostly for ""The Prestige.""  After Inception and Dark Knight Rises though he has fallen a bit.  Kurosawa is obviously highly regarded in my collection.  

8. Being proud of something in my collection is kind of a weird concept.  I really enjoy owning the bigass collectors edition of my favorite film, Lawrence of Arabia.  If I had to save one from a fire it would be it.  2nd would be either be my Criterion of The Third Man or my equally bigass Kurosawa box set.

9.  I'm not looking forward to a whole lot.  I've been trying to limit my purchases as my backlog grows.  I really want The Hobbit Extended Edition just to delve into the extras.  Otherwise I would like to pick up Chaplin's City Lights eventually. 

10. I organize my collection by type first: dvd, blu, tv, box sets, criterion, Disney.  Then it is alphabetical for dvds and blus.  TV goes by series wherever it will fit.  Box sets get thrown anywhere with certain ones more prominent than others.  Criterion is by spine number, always.

11. I don't use any software or apps to keep track.  Perhaps I should?  Maybe when it gets to cumbersome I'll eventually get an excel sheet.  Until then I have a pretty good memory and can remember most all of my titles.

Thanks for looking!

We have two cars in both of our names and my wife had a Student Loan that she has paid in full (otherwise no other credit history). My score is around 780 and I just decided to run her report and found that a hospital bill she had from before we were married had went into collections and was basically unpaid. She had been paying $10 a month which is what she said she owed, I thought it was just an agreement with the hospital and figured it didn't hurt to not pay it off since it was interest free (my mom does the same).

It turns out that the hospital bills were split across 5 accounts and total $1,430 unpaid.  Her score according to Experian is 599 btw.

So I'm unsure what to do. We'll definitely pay that balance off immediately.  After that should we post-pone our plans of home ownership until her score improves or go ahead now and hopefully refinance later? 

Basically, should we wait for her score to improve to get a better interest rate down the road or should we lock in the currently low interest rates with a mortgage now.  I'm leaning towards going ahead with the mortgage since any improvement in our possible interest rate will be offset by the rising interest rates. Other options include just putting me on the mortgage I guess (I make twice as much as her).

tl;dr looking to buy a home but while my credit is 783 my wife's is 599 due to an unpaid hospital bill from before we were married. Continue with home or wait for improved score?

edit update:  Thank you so much for all the helpful replies.  I ended up contacting the agency for a ""pay for delete"" and they obliged.  Hopefully it drops of off her report soon.  I had no idea the inner workings of how much power these creditors have with the credit agencies.  This has been a very instructive thread.  Thank you all again!

edit #2: ran the report and score again today just for fun. Her score went from 599 to 674!!! Awesome. Thanks again everybody!","In the process of buying a home, just found out wife's credit score is way lower than mine."

Here you have what I believe is called a spalted black limba Strat body (not really sure if it is technically ""spalted"" or not). A canary/ebony 24 3/4 neck. And 3 Seymour Duncan antiquity mini humbuckers. It has an interesting sound with the strat body and the mini humbuckers. Basically it is like a Strat-Firebird. It also has quite an acoustic sound too which is quite pleasing.

It is a completely custom job of which I am the second owner. The only flaw is the tuning peg for the high e string was originally partially drilled a bit too large. I could not get a good picture of it. However, the peg is in there solid and I haven't had any issues with it.

It has locking tuners, Acme Guitar Works pick guard assembly, an earvana nut, and Wilkinson trem. It also comes in a hardshell case.

This guitar has been Plek'd at a nearby music store and plays like a beast. The action is perfect. It looks amazing. And it feels perfect in my hands. I have played quite a few great brand-name guitars from Les Pauls to Stratocasters to Jem's and this is the best feeling and sounding guitar of them all. The only reason I am selling it is because 1) I need the money, 2) I just don't play it enough. This guitar deserves to be played for an audience and cared for, not stored under a baby crib for bedroom play.

Just typing out the description makes me not want to go through with it but this guitar really deserves somebody who will play it more than me. It is absolutely beautiful and with it being plek'd it plays better than any guitar I have ever owned. It also has natural masked binding which I'm not even sure what that means but it has gotta be good!

A little background : so I played 20 days total and I am currently a lvl 134 ranked Gold I. My kill/death ratio orbits around 1.5 to 1.7. Astral Wave is my actual Xbone gamertag if you want to connect with me ;) (French / English).

The first months playing R6 were really great, very intense matches, I got addicted to it straight away. I started as a noob and climbed the ladder to eventually become a pretty good player. I was capable of acing whole teams if need be and got my peers' respect for saving the day quite often (I could kill up to 20 ppl in ranked matches while only dying 1 to 2 times).

But since a week or so... my experience with this game is taking an unexpected turn. I can't seem to be able to handle more than 2 kills per round or survive more than 2 minutes. I blame it on me and my unwillingness to keep up with the new style a lot of people seem to chose over a realistic strategy : rushing, roaming, going outside to cheap kill, using glitches...

I know it has been discussed at length here and I am not really complaining about it, it can make for an interesting match and forces you to be even more aware of your surroundings. But I am not that kind of player. And as this trend is rampant, I don't enjoy R6 anymore. If I want to play like this, I just go on Call of Duty.

So for people who share the same vision as me, please connect with me :) Also, I am considering switching for a PC. A mouse and a keyboard would be more than welcome (note to myself : never buy an Elite controller ever again, this sh*t is garbage).

My proposed fixes for Ubi : 
- Work on sever issues and mitigate ghost kills 
- Limit the time allowed to spend outside while defending (someone else proposed 7 sec which I think is a good number) 
- Make aiming more difficult while hit by an opponent (I can't count how many times I got shotguned in the face by someone I was already tearing apart - not too realistic...). 
- Work on the kick system, sometimes the option doesn't show up for some reason. Also, I think ppl abuse it when available. Personally, I never kick someone from my team who TK me inadvertently. 
- Put more options to customize controls and sensitivity on consoles. - Nerf Pulse 
- Add a way to visually distinguish veterans from newbies (uniforms for instance). Just for style and respect :P 
- Keep up with the good work, this game can be awesome again.

What do you think? Is the community killing the game or do you welcome the rushing/roaming trend?

Cheers :)",From Good to Noob in a week

I found [this chart](http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Raids#Loot) from the wikia wiki page. It shows that at Town Hall 7, 18%, 50% and 3% are lootable from Storages, Collectors and Treasury respectively. I was wondering if this number is accurate and up to date. Today I was raided two times and each time I had over 2 mil gold and around 1.25 mil elixir. All my storages are of the same level, as are all collectors. One gold mine and one elixir collector are being upgraded. The amount of gold available from the Townhall was logically higher than the amount of Elixir. The amount of gold and elixir in the Treasury are exactly the same. However, in each of the raids, the total amount of gold obtainable was lower that the elixir amount.

To illustrate, [here](http://i.imgur.com/Td1e11w.jpg) is a screenshot. The image on the lower panel shows the amount I had left just after the top raid (25m ago). So, I had over 2.5 mil Gold and around 1.5 mil Elixir when the raid happened. Logically the elixir offered should have been lower than the gold offered. but what happened was actually the reverse. So, it is pretty evident that the gold and elixir offered percentages are not equal. What is the current system? Is it such that the percentage of elixir grabbable is higher or the percentage of the lower resource is higher?",[ASK] What percentage of Gold and Elixir are grabbable?

I generally can control him well and guide him inside the base when deploying him after a wide funnel has been created. However, on some occasions his moves are a bit odd. It may very well be my lack of understanding.

Here I'm showing a few scenarios from some raids I did today. 

[In this ](http://i.imgur.com/bcZhfmq.png) image, the BK takes out the Elixir storage (marked red X) and then turns to the Wizard tower. I later understood it was because the Gold Storage was 7 tiles away, so the closest target was the Wizard tower.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/nRVXppH.png) he takes out the buildings predictably without retargeting to the cannon below the red arrow.

[In this case](http://i.imgur.com/i3fUsok.png) red crosses mark the buildings he took out. The blue arrows are where there is a one tile gap between two buildings. He didn't change target to defenses inside the wall in the first blue arrow (on the right), but did so in the second. This is very unpredictable. Situations like this has cost me quite a few raids.

Now to the oddest one I've ever faced. [In this video](https://vid.me/Zo5o) you can see that he ignores the Archer Tower completely and goes for a Builder's hut which is well away from him.

So what am I missing that I should know about the BK AI? How can I predict his moves better?

I've been mulling over this idea since D2 launched. In between obscene amount of time playing D1, I got into Final Fantasy XIV. Once you reach the endgame in FFXIV each class (job) has a relic weapon to chase. I ground this quest out and it took me a couple months. It was long, but when I was done I had a fully customized weapon at the max item level. After finishing the quest my first thought was, ""Why doesn't Destiny have ANYTHING like this?""


Well with the current state of the Endgame, I think now is atleast the time to suggest it. With CoO we got the Forge which could have been a step in the right direction and could be built on. I wouldn't just want to see 1 weapon though. I don't think that would work for D2. I think for Destiny there should be an item for every slot. Each individual weapon would have its own quest and you could only take on 1 quest per weapon slot (so 1 power weapon, 1 energy and 1 kinetic) simultaneously. The rest of the gear set (helmet, arms, chest, legs, class item and ghost) would have 1 quest for the set, but the quest for that set would should take twice the work compared to the weapon quests. Once completed each piece would drop at max Power Level, with the catch that none of them can be infused to higher power levels. When the next power level increase comes...a new step in the quest would start to increase the gearset with you.


##The Weapons

My idea here is that each weapon type: Hand Cannon, Scout Rifle, Auto Rifle, SMG, Pulse Rifle and Side Arm in the kinetic and energy slots then Sword, Rocket Launcher, Fusion Rifle, Linear Fusion Rifle, Sniper, Shotgun Grenade Launcher(lulz) would each have a quest. During the Life of the content you could get as many or as few as you like. There would be a quest for kinetic or energy as I stated above you would only be able to take a quest for 1 weapon for each slot at a time. 


My idea to start this quest would be that there would be a random item drop in game, much like the Dvalin Relics of the Sleeper Quest and while you have this item no other items will drop. When you have this item in your inventory you are prompted to speak with the gunsmith who informs you that you've recovered some schematics, but it will take some materials to process. At this point you'll choose the weapon type and in the case of kinetic and energy weapons you'll choose which slot it fills. The next step of the quest is obviously some resource collection, but it should be a variety of resources. I think the prophecy weapons have a good concept behind them, but once you return with the required materials you'll get a bare bones base stat weapon at the max power -20 of the content in which the set was first released (I.E. if this set was released in CoO the first bare bones weapon would drop at power level 315).


As you progress through the next several steps you'll have the options to customize base stats on a max total points system. For instance if I wanted to make my scout rifle all impact and reload...it's going to cost me in stability and range. If I wanted an auto rifle that is all stability it will cost in other areas.

Further in the questline, you'll finalize the perks on your weapon. I realize weapons like this break PVP, but if you reduce them to the base stats of the gun and leave the perks unavailable in PVP...it works.

The final step in the quest would be to basically use the weapon to strengthen its light. That step for the relic weapon was great, but to take it from 315 to 335 you would need to use it in relevant content (heroic strikes, nightfalls, heroic adventures, raids, etc).


##The Armor

The armor would work similarly to the weapon quests as a different item would spawn once per character (unless you accidentally dismantled it...in which case another item would randomly drop and allow you to kick off the quest). I think the armor quest should take about twice the work of a weapon quest, but it does give the entire set in one go including a ghost.


##Where I'm stuck

I'm not an artist at all so I don't I can't show any pictures. We have artists in this community that could dream these things up though. I would like to open this idea to the community to see what could be produced. I'm also the worst person in the world to design the quest line. What I could do in a week would take some people a month to do. I don't think anything should be time gated. I think as far as the random item drop to kick off the quest there should be some secret conditions that need to be met. 

Has character finished campaign?
Does character meet minimum Power Level threshold?
Has Character gotten X #of kills in this area since PL threshold?


Beyond that I would love to hear feedback from the reddit. I'd also love to see if you have ideas you'd like to contribute here. Will bungie implement it? Probably not, but it's worth putting out there.


GuitarCFD",True Endgame Gearsets
348,h24vp,14066,False,False,True,False,GuitarCFD,503,GuitarCFD,7gwtlp,2017-12-01 21:10:11,3.0,3.0,"Slayerage put out the video that we've all been talking about that made the point that many of us on this reddit were talking about before the D2 Beta even dropped. 2 primaries and a heavy make for some extremely limited loadouts. However, I'm of the opinion that the current weapon system can be adjusted without moving back to D1's Primary/Special/Heavy system. I'll reference [this spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xl4Je-x6AXJRGtHm6VXj6UgskQ_l0gy4Cz6lrmZrZWs/edit?usp=sharing) that I put together in the first month or so of D2. All weapon's were tested against the same Ultra in the same zone and all weapons tested were well over the PL cap of that enemy. With those conditions on place it gives you a clear picture of how each weapon compares to others in a level playing field without having to account for damage buffs. 


When looking at that spreadsheet the snipers are no longer accurate, because I needed to adjust the reserve ammo to come up with the math involved here. 


As they are now a sniper is always a second choice for people who know what they're doing. No offence if you like snipers in D2, but the truth is they drastically underperform Curtain Call, Sins of the Past and Merciless...even when getting crits. It's important to note that when I refer to being outperformed there are 2 factors you have to consider. DPS is certainly a big one, but you also have to consider your total damage output (on the spreadsheet as ""damage potential""). To get your head around that we can use Sweet Business as a prime example. It is the highest DPS of any NON POWER weapon, but it also has the lowest overall damage output of any NON POWER weapon. So what does that mean? Sure you're going to pump out what damage you can quickly, but your overall contribution is going to be the smallest compared to your other options. High damage output shouldn't be the deciding factor in your Kinetic slot anyways, but that's a discussion for a different post.


So when we talk about snipers why are they so lackluster? Well the main cause is their overall damage output is so low. Compared to Rocket Launchers and Merciless in my testing that put their damage potential above 24,000-25,000 (this was against a PL 170 ultra that's why those numbers seem low), snipers struggle to get their damage potential anywhere close to 20,000. These numbers are all assuming you are a deadshot and only hitting crits. 


So what's the answer? It's actually pretty simple. In their current state, snipers have around a 2.5 Crit multiplier. Increase the crit multiplier to 3.5 and increase max ammo capacity from ~14 to ~18. These 2 changes suddenly make snipers deal equal overall damage to cluster bomb rockets AS LONG AS YOU GET ALL CRITS. This change also keeps snipers from breaking PVP since you aren't giving them a damage boost a headshot is still OHK, but a body shot is unchanged. At the same time you are rewarding a skilled hand with more damage. That change would allow max impact snipers like show of force to put out nearly twice the damage of Cluster Bomb rockets or merciless, but with less actual DPS...it's also worth stating that you only get that increase if you are getting crits. In fact, you would have to get atleast 50% crits to match the damage capacity of the current power weapon slot choices.


Sorry for the wall of text. This has been on my mind quite a bit lately, this change wouldn't fix the game, just address an issue where using lower skilled weapons are more rewarding than weapons that take thumbskill to use.


TL;DR Increase sniper crit multiplier to 3.5 and ammo capacity to 18 to bring them up to a damage output that equals the leading power slot choices, but with a lower dps.",Alternative to moving Snipers to the Energy Slot

I need you to understand that this list is not complete, but I do feel it is complete *enough* to draw the important conclusions. I had to set up some pretty tight controls that I'll talk about in the next section. The most important thing I need you to understand is that I'm not stating an opinion. Numbers are awesome that way...they don't have an opinion...they are just numbers.


##Controls


Any time you test damage, there are variables that you need to control. Probably the most important of these is the Power Level of the weapons I was testing. Getting everything at 305 to have a pure test of damage didn't seem feasible. So I needed another way to control the fluctuations that varied Power Levels might produce. I also needed to make sure I was hitting an unshielded Ultra. You may not be aware, but weapons behave differently on Ultras than they do on majors or red bar enemies. DPS is usually only applicable against raid or strike bosses that are almost always Ultras. So in the Winding Cove section of the EDZ there is a Cabal Excavation Public Event. The Ultra that spawns when the event goes Heroic is a power level of around 160-170. I'm sure there are exact numbers, but what it means for this post is that as long as the weapons I used were above 290 I was safely above the damage cap. I think it would be safe to say that any weapons above 270 are well beyond the damage cap, but I like to err on the side of overkill.


##Important Notes On This Particular Spreadsheet


I separated weapons based on their IMPACT tier. I know there has been a trend of using the listed Rate of Fire, but there are subtle differences in these archetypes magazine size, handling speeds even stability to some extent will have an effect on the time it takes to empty a magazine, reload and begin firing again. 


You'll notice I have 2 columns for DPS. ""Magazine"" and ""Reserve"" DPS. Both of these are important. Magazine DPS will give you a good comparison for the times that you have persistent rally barricades, while Reserve DPS is the number you need to use for comparison almost any time you need to reload. 

##[Here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xl4Je-x6AXJRGtHm6VXj6UgskQ_l0gy4Cz6lrmZrZWs/edit?usp=sharing) is the spreadsheet. 


##The Winners In Each Category Create a Problem


While merciless may not win hands down in the Power Weapons on my sheet, we learned in Datto's video that Merciless can get a type of crit bonus against Calus specifically. After watching that video I went back to my test site and tried multiple times to see if it had the same effect in heroic events. I can say with 100% certainty that it does NOT. So far as I can tell Merciless only gets this bonus against Calus. With that in mind, you could potentially raise the damage per trigger pull of merciless by about 40% assuming that that you ""crit"" 4 of the 7 bolts. That isn't insignificant. The merciless vs cluster bomb rockets definitely needs to be tested more, but for my numbers I'm currently calling merciless the winner in the Power Weapon Category. Coldheart is the clear winner for Energy and Sweet Business for Kinetic.

*Merciless
*Coldheart
*Sweet Business

Anyone else see the problem? If you go buy DPS alone Merciless is the clear winner. It simply puts out more damage in a relatively short period of time when compared to it's competitors. Cluster bomb Rocket Launchers definitely are a competitor, but when you factor the merciless crit potential, I just don't THINK rockets will keep up...BUT as I said NEEDS more tests for sure.


In my mind Merciless wins the exotic slot contest simply because of how quickly it dumps out its potential damage. In roughly 24 seconds...compared to the 46 seconds of Sweet Business (for less damage) and 57 seconds for Coldheart. That isn't the only reason though. With merciless, there are several other viable options in the other categories. I think the numbers show that the 18 Impact tier ENERGY Autorifles such as Valakadyn and Perseverance outperform the rest through reloads. While the 29 impact tier seems to dominate in a mag for mag comparison. So if you have plenty of rally barricades go with the 29, if you don't go with an 18.

For kinetics my recommendation is Ghost Primus. I prefer a weapon that will deal stable dps through reloads and Ghost Primus does that. It gets beat out mag for mag by a couple weapons, but the longer you have to shoot it, the more it outperforms all of them.


##What do I do with this?

My hope when I started testing these weapons...was that I would find a 1kys or Warpath dps monster that was just hiding somewhere. I didn't. My overall conclusion from everything is that there are quite a few combinations you can use that will provide adequate dps for current content. Some combinations will provide a marginal increase, but from what I can tell there is no Black Spindle or Sleeper Simulant type DPS king. Maybe it's still hiding.


##Final Thoughts

Thank you for reading this wall of text. I dumped quite a bit of time into this. Each line in that spreadsheet represents a solo heroic public event and a rate of fire video (I'm OCD and measured fire rates down to the frame). Over all I was disappointed. On one hand there is the freedom that there are multiple load outs that work and will provide adequate dps. On the other hand every thing is adequate and nothing is amazing.

I included a link to just the damage phase for those who don't want to watch a 3 minute video, unfortunately even that is too long for a .gif or I'd include that as well.


##Strategy

Strategy for this was pretty simple, but timing was key. Warpriest at 390 has 4,000,000 health so getting to that amount of damage in 45 (really 50) seconds is the hardest point with only 3 people focused on DPS while the aura holder is doing what he/she can. First tether was timed so that when the rest of us hit our first sleeper shots the tether was already engaged. From there it is spreading out the tether to squeeze as much out of as possible. The 3 focused on DPS had 15 sleeper shots (more info below on how that works) and the aura holder used Spindle. The only thing after that is try not to miss.


##Thoughts After Completion

[We're on a kick of doing 1 phase boss kills right now] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/6febpk/warpriest_vosik_and_golgoroth_390_all_1_phased/). Kind of our farewell to a game that has been an unhealthy obsession in all of our lives. Golgoroth 1 phase was probably the most demanding. It required 6 people performing perfectly. I don't know that 4 man Warpriest is quite at that level of difficulty, but it was definitely close. Originally we planned to go with a Spindle/Warpath, the math says it works...the truth is it's more you are at the mercy of sniper flinch. I'm not great sniper, but I'm not a slouch either after a few tries I noticed that my reticle was getting knocked around by taking fire from acolytes much more than you do with a 6 man team. I wish that was the only problem, we several runs that got fouled by White Nail completely bugging out. I'll bring the video evidence, but several times one of us would get 3 crits and White Nail wouldn't proc. So after a few failed runs we said, ""let's just try it with sleeper."" It took several runs to get everything perfect, but we eventually got it. 


##Team EXE

All the credit goes to my raid team. We've been together doing things like this for over a year now. There is no doubt in my mind that I am the LEAST skilled member. Special thanks to my teammates and friends in this video Shift Seven, An Epic Moment and ThadJarvice (Sable and Teet3rs are also members but sat out on this one).


##15 Sleeper Shot Information

I will inevitably get questioned on this so here is how it works. You need any combination of a Year 1 extra fusion ammo perk coupled with the Extra Heavy Ammo perk.

Titan: Year 1 Chestpiece with Extra Fusion Ammo + Y1 Crota or VoG boots.

Hunter: Year 1 Lucky Raspberry

Warlock: Year 1 Starfire Protocol OR Year 1 Heart of Praxic Fire.


Equip the above mentioned pieces of gear and pick up ammo or pop a synth, then switch back to max light gear.

This one was sentimental for us. Warpriest was the first boss we One Phased as a team back in the 320 King's Fall Heroic days. So dispensing him first was quick and easy. Two Titans, 4 Hunters and everyone uses sleeper. He died with nearly 2.5 stacks of Aura left.

[Vosik] (https://youtu.be/ANAQzaMyEJ4) 3m 44s

[Damage Phase] (https://youtu.be/ANAQzaMyEJ4?t=2m34s)


Vosik was a boss we all felt since RoI we could 1 phase, but had never gotten it done...and then when we did it we were like, ""this wasn't as hard as we thought it would be...we should have done this alot sooner."" So a couple of things with Vosik. First, technically Spindle would be the absolute best weapon to use on him...if it wasn't for his stagger. Beyond a doubt if everyone in the team could empty spindle shots into him he would die alot faster than this. Second, we cheesed this pretty hard. If you watch the full video you'll see that we held a bomb on the 3rd round so that 4 bombs on the last round would do damage to his health instead of shields. We plan to go back and do it with no bombs doing damage at a later time. This still felt good though. On day one this encounter has been my least favorite...so making him look like a punk was gratifying.

[Damage Phase] (https://youtu.be/AwPQpUVvOnE?t=1m20s)

In the 335 edition of King's Fall Golgoroth was the first boss we one phased where we felt like we accomplished something. It took coordination as a team and nearly perfect execution. In the 390 version it goes to a new level. It takes perfect execution between the orb drop, 1st tether, gaze taken, Nighthawks fired and then the quiver from the gaze holder. On top of that the entire dps team has to nearly empty their spindles. This is by far the least forgiving boss for a 1 phase kill and I say that as someone who has killed everything possible in a single phase. 24.2M Damage in 20 seconds.

My crew has been using a small variant of that to consistently farm. What I'd like to talk about here is why this is working and how you can adjust these strategies to better fit your team. The main problem I'm seeing with these posts is that it requires a 335 void sniper if you don't understand the math involved. So let's break it down. I'll be referencing /u/pl4y3r82000 post because he uses no weapon's of light or tether. It gives me cleaner numbers to work with. 

First let's break it down:

 A 335 Void 1000 yard stare archetype sniper will crit hit the boss at 43,169 and body shot 17,279. 

A 335 Hung Jury archetype Scout will body shot the boss at ~943. (I say ""~"" because when standing at the back...range fall of sometimes becomes an issue but it's a difference of 5 damage points per shot)

I have the burn ticks from dragon's breath clocked at 663 but different people are getting different damage numbers there. He is consistently taking 4 damage ticks from fire before he dies.

My only unknown in this process is the exact damage number he's taking from the rocket itself. If anyone has a screenshot or video showing the number of a 335 dragons breath hitting with area damage I would love that.


So now the math

21 Precision sniper shots (43,196 x 7) = 907,116

1 sniper body shot = 17,279

7 scout rifle body shots = 6601

All together comes up just short of 931,000 total damage. This SHOULD be your goal. If you get to that amount of damage and hit the ground point plank with a dragon's breath...you should have a successful farm every time. The biggest inconsistency we have noticed is that distance to the boss matters when you fire the rocket. If you are too far away the boss won't die. I'm assuming this is because the bosses health is almost right at 940,000. I think the rocket AoE damage does ~6000 and then the fire tick from dragon's breath does the rest. 

If you are 335 and go after this strategy I recommend you start with the number of shots as pl4y3r suggested and then augment for more damage if needed. If you need more damage...do it as incrementally as possible. I was using a cocytus. When more damage was needed with me doing 2 body shots (1132 per), I increased to a crit (1690) and a body for a total increase of about 500. And then the magic number int hat group was 2 crit shots from my cocytus.


Why this is important. 


If you are like me on PS4 I'm not 335, but i'd like an imago! Knowing the math involved allows me to adjust to suit my needs. 

If you are lower light want to figure this strategy out. Get to the boss and take note of your damage numbers. Get a sniper crit, sniper body, scout crit and scout body. then break down the math to suit your farming method. 

Remember it's always better to wipe before killing the boss than the other way around. So increase that damage in small steps so you don't have to rerun the strike!

I was able to go 1-30 in basically a weekend and then begin working on that GS. I noticed from posts on this reddit that I needed to be focused more on stats than GS. So anytime I would get a new piece of gear...regardless of score...I would check to see if it increased stats without decreasing others. About a week ago I reached a point where I wasn't getting gear that increased my stats. So my next course of action was to start re-rolling gear. I'm sure I've made mistakes there, but I feel like just doing it a few times gave me a good handle on things I should change or shouldn't. Once I was no longer getting decent gains from re-rolling gear. I bought all the blueprints for gear mods and weapon mods and started crafting like crazy. 

At this point I'm 175/320/12. My GS is 247 and I feel like I hit a wall. I fill like my GS is a little inflated for the stats I have (atleast comparing to stats I was seeing posted pre UG.)

So my question is...where do I go from here? I know how to get gear, my biggest problem is that if I got a piece of gear that might be good by re-rolling I might not recognize it. So...any tips?

Since the raid was still going to be a big part of bringing up our light level...I was slightly worried about how only having 17 (19 with a ""more special ammo"" perk) shots with my spindle would impact the over all dps. 

After running the raid 3x this week. My honest opinion is...IT HASN'T MADE A DIFFERENCE AT ALL! I've seen the posts about people running out of ammo. I've had 1 single experience where I ran out of primary ammo, only because I hadn't taken the time to run around and pick up boxes.

In my opinion, the change puts a little more emphasis on your overall load out, rather than just your main dps choice. I'm still a fan of Spindle/Terminus for warpriest and Golgoroth. Sleeper/1kys OR Eirene RRF both work well also if you have triple tap on the sniper. If you're having trouble with ammo drops. Make sure you keep in mind that your ammo drops are based on your kills. Each kill you get gives you a chance for ammo. Personally I've had more ammo laying around than I can pick up, white, green and purple. 

If you are having problems with ammo dropping. Consider your choice of primary. I say this because a hand cannon is a suitable choice if you're holding down the middle at warpriest where everything is in your face, but you are better off with a scout if you're shooting from cover on right or left. For golgoroth, i prefer to go with a scout rifle there as well as crit shots will deal significant damage to ads in some cases 1 shot them. 

One thing this nerf does do is make it alot LESS acceptable to equip a rocket launcher in the raid. 

I may be the exception, but I no one in my team has experienced an ammo shortage either. ",My Take on the Sniper Ammo Nerf

Something you should know along the way, that I haven't seen posted. Pay attention to those legendary engrams you start to pick up. The light level they drop at is MUCH LESS IMPORTANT than the perks they come with.


I've run across more than one TakenTot who has found the right path to progression...ready to take on the raid, only to find out they recently dismantled 1000 Yard Stares with insane rolls because they dropped with a low Light Level. 


The way this game is supposed to work. You find load outs that you like (and that will change the more you play) and infuse those purple and yellow weapons as you get higher LL weapons and armor. You can LOCK any weapon or piece of armor you deem important to ensure they don't accidentally get dismantled or infused into other gear.


As you are going through strikes and getting legendary engrams here are some that you can watch for:


1000 Yard Stare: Triple Tap is your primary concern most will roll with a shortgaze or tacsys scope. Perfect Balance or Explosive Rounds. Unflinching is my favorite perk in the last slot, but there are several that are fun to work with.


ANY AUTO RIFLE: Look for stability perks. Counterbalance, Rodeo, Persistence, Braced Frame. As a bonus, if you run across one that has Extended Mag AND Glass Half Full...keep it.


Hand Cannons: I'm not a master here...but Triple Tap and Firefly are FUN to play with...if you get an Imago Loop with those two on it and dismantle it...several on this reddit will dismember you...small pieces at a time.

Scout Rifles: Again...not my strong suit, but the perks I find most useful are Triple Tap and Extended Mag, stability perks like Perfect (Counter?) balance reduce the severity of recoil and help you keep on target, so those are nice to have.


Shotguns: If it doesn't have Rangefinder...just dismantle it and move on.


Machine Guns: Extended Mag and Stability Perks. I find perks like Life Leach useful when clearing ads.


Rocket Launchers: IMO not great for PvE...and don't want people using them in the raid, BUT for pure fun...tracking, cluster bomb...anything that increases your magazine size. Just point and shoot and enjoy your day.

Also...there are other weapons that you can only get once per character...if you get an exotic weapons as a quest reward...never dismantle it. The number of people I know that infused Touch of Malice into their primary because it dropped at 310...its unbelievable. (Ok that's not entirely true...any exotic you discover you can reclaim from the Exotic Weapons Blueprint Kiosk...but its legendary marks and exotic shards to buy it...and you get it at 280 and have to infuse it back up to the original drop level.

I started from scratch with people who had been through the raid atleast once normal or hard and knew the basic mechanics of the raid. I don't consider myself a sherpa, but I know enough about the mechanics of the raid to get newbies through it without TOO many wipes. Warpriest challenge I was really proud of my raid team most teams I took through did it on the first try. Got the challenge done quickly on all 3 characters. When golgoroth came up, only 1 person knew how to take the gaze (hint: it wasn't me), so he taught us how he did it and we all adapted it to make it work for us. It took work to get the timing and everything down (low dps due to low light levels, but we got the timing down and made it work). I was again very proud of my team, but I started to notice a trend. I've seen multiple posts about how HM Oryx challenge exposed the ""posers"". When HM Oryx challenge dropped I couldn't wait to get home to get my team together and get this knocked out. In order to defeat Oryx came the immediate problem that we first had to get to oryx. Warpriest and Golgoroth were immediate 1st try encounters. Totems had a hang up or two, but hey...its Totems. Then we get to daughters...and this...this is where my team started to unravel. As soon as we arrive at daughters, the relic appears and I hear, ""guardian down!"" WHAT!? Dead player, ""I was torn...I don't know how to run."" ""Well bud, guess what we all have to wipe now, because this is hard mode and you are just as likely to get it next time. More than that though, I would rather you fail first...than get torn on the second run and not know what to do and we have to wipe after a good first run."" I blame him for being timid, but I also blame every raid team he's ever been with for not teaching him that before I got to him. For every random group he joins...you can thank me...he now knows how to run the relic quickly...it took exactly 1 try with a little direction. Daughters took it out of me the first night and I didn't want to start the Oryx encounter frustrated. Only 2 of us had beaten oryx on HM...so I knew it was going to be a fight and I wanted to come back fresh. Day 2 started out promising...we would get to phase 3 or 4 and ogre's would start teleporting. It seems like an easy fix to just have the extra guys run out and grab them, but as a team battling their first encounter it never seemed to sync. But I had hope, for some reason thursday just didn't pan out (don't blame people it is the holiday season and family time/real life is more important than a game. So I worked on some crucible bounties...worked on my sunsinger subclass (I main a titan). Friday I was head strong I am getting this challenge done on atleast one character. So when my raid team wasn't online I took to the lfg for xbox360...I'm a defender titan and decent light level...wasn't hard to find a group. When that didn't work out I got pickier and just started selecting teams who were asking for people with certain light levels and claimed to have already finished the challenge atleast once. Several groups had the emblem applied to the characters and they were helping friends complete the challenge. My job is simple...kill the ogres...assist in killing the knights and don't friggin die...job complete. No challenge completed. This was my story all Friday and Saturday. Sunday morning I needed a break, but wanted to get the challenge done...my friend hit me up and asked me to help him take a group of newbies through the normal raid. (Apparently they were getting hounded on an LFG chat and told they would never get through the raid) That pissed me off because I knew better. We got them to oryx with only 1 wipe at Totems due to Teleporting melee knights. No biggie I expected more, but they all rose to the occassion. At oryx we were having real issues with server ticks. Ogres teleporting everywhere...random deaths to misadventure, but they stuck it out. We get to the 4th phase...I see 16 bombs detonate...oryx somehow still has 3/4 of his health...Destiny servers right? who knows. Either way I took a break and went to xbox1 for the LFG...you know...where the ""elite"" players hang out. I went through the raid with some really good guys who were burned out on doing the oryx fight (I don't blame them...I am to). Started fresh and went to (or thru) golgoroth (its all a blur at this point). But I managed to get all my characters atleast up to Oryx on the hard raid and I got a 320 Titan Mark for my Titan at daughters (my first RNG 320 Drop...so it wasn't a complete waste). Team after team fell at oryx. I started recognizing what was making teams failing, bad leadership, lack of communication or just people with winning the ""heads up"" award (hint: its not for being aware of what's going on!). At this point I became the player that I hate. I will give any team a shot, but if I'm spending 2 hours trying to beat an encounter that isn't THAT difficult...I'm out...I'm not saying a word because if I do its going to get me muted.

(I only recently got all 3 to a level to attempt the hard raid...much less a challenge mode). A friend and I had started a clan the week the Warpriest challenge started and we had ALOT of success with it and everyone was growing quickly. 

When the Golgoroth Challenge went live, we went to work immediately. Most of our members were still low light (303-306) and not many of us had ToM much less Black Spindle. Add to that most of the time on Golgoroth we had 1 person that would ALWAYS hold gaze. We finally worked out a strategy that would work for us. It took alot. We finally beat it on Friday (early Saturday)...and it was hands down my most memorable event in Destiny. 

As I said there was alot of ""working out the kinks."" We finally had a run that was going smoothly. We had him down to the ""O"" after the first run and no problems passing gaze. Round 2 he was just barely over half health. I was feeling really good. Round 3 was another great damage phase and we were sure he would be down in the next round, but as it happens Golgoroth wasn't playing ball in our plan for his demise...so the bubble was shot down and Golgoroth turned around before the first gaze grabber could capture gaze. We managed to clutch it and get damage in, and with Melting point and WoL  I was just waiting for him to fall, but he DIDN'T and as soon as we jumped out of the pit those words of dread in this challenge flashed on the screen, ""Enrage Is Near!"" To make it worse he was so near dead you couldn't even see yellow on the health bar! We were still passing gaze and I was second to take it so as soon as it the right side had taken it from me. I pulled out my HMG and dropped the bubble. The guy next on my side got his gaze and I was already in the pool. 2 shots from my spindle and I see the ""Golgoroth Is Enraged"" text just as he fell to the ground. You can imagine the words I was hearing before anyone realized I had downed him. Plenty of aggravated F bombs...promptly followed by ""wait...who did it? WE DID IT!!!"" It was satisfying going from the guy who was carried through the raid only a couple months ago...to the guy who was clutching the moment and knew exactly what to do. That being said...the kid that was holding gaze was someone I knew could hold him long enough for me to get the job done and he had NEVER held gaze before that day. It was a GREAT moment made possible by faith in my team mate. That is what this game is about for me. My clan as well...we don't need people who are great by themselves...give us the guys who are willing to grind it out and find a way to make it work...because they will eventually be flawless at the raid. 

That was just the start of my weekend too...the next day we helped a guy get 2 of his Exotic Swords and he was extatic...hey I was too when I got mine. Couple of our guys got their ToM last week. Then yesterday some guys that had it coming got their black spindle after a few hours of figuring it out. (The same strategy doesn't work for everyone).

I love recording guitar tracks so I bought a POD Studio UX2. It gave me the ability to lay down tracks and record vocal if I decided to. I also had a Blue Spark for tracking melodies. I never felt confident in balancing vocals or getting a good vocal sound. So for my Let's Play channel I've finally gotten tired of my Headset Mic and all the background noise that comes with it. I spent a few hours last night trying to manipulate the sound. I am able to completely cut out the background which was awesome. Pop filter made a huge difference as well for me. My problem now is that, to me, the vocal sounds are really gainy. Common sense to me is to turn down the gain on the input. Only problem is, once I do that audio levels get really LOW.

You need some back ground I guess so here goes. I'm still, what I consider, ""freshly"" divorced. Its been a year and a half, so everything is still kind of a fresh wound. As far as the kids are concerned, until now not much had changed in my relationship with them. The only thing I fought for in the divorce was more than every other weekend. I ended up getting them, usually a couple days during the week for a couple hours. It was the only thing I cared about. At that point, after 7 years, I had basically defined myself as a husband and father. I would come home from work and get busy with my oldest son doing homework. Cooking dinner and then, later getting my youngest to sleep. At first not having 3 boys in my house...there was something about the silence that drove me crazy. If any of you have had a house full of boys, I'm sure you know what I mean. Our during the week the last year or so has been spent doing what we would normally do. We had a few super hero TV shows that we enjoyed watching so we'd get something to eat and gather around the TV to watch The Flash or The Arrow, my kids are also lovers of Dr. Who which made my...well everything. My kids have the same sci fi love that I do. Every once in awhile we'd take a trip to see my family or go fishing, etc. But I've never been ""fun dad"" or ""creative dad""...I've just kindof been ""dad"". And that's fine...my kids know I'm there. But fast forward to now. My kids are now 3 hours away...my days of having them during the week are done. And there is now a new full time man in their life, whom my ex wife didn't feel I needed to meet. I would think that would be a courtesy. I know nothing about this guy. The boys like him ok...they think he's a little strict, which I'm ok with. I'd rather have someone with stricter rules than I have...its refreshing and tells me this guy atleast gives a fuck.

All this so you can understand my frame of mine. I'm seriously dreading only having my kids twice a month. With 3 doing things other than visiting family or watching TV gets tough, they all have different interests and finding things that will entertain all of us gets difficult.

My concern is that my influence in my kids lives is about to be drastically cut if not completely removed.I would like some advice if someone has been in this type of situation. What can I do in the brief times that I have my kids to maximize my time with them? I suck at organization so be as specific as possible please.",Divorced...Father of 3 boys...help!

So last night's episode was all about the repercussions of changing the past. If Barry goes back and saves his mother, the world he knows will no longer exist. Instead he would have grown up with his real parents, his mother not killed by Eobard and by default his father does NOT got to prison for life for that murder. With that logic he would never have moved in with the West family. Now we have a problem. When Eddie shoots himself, erasing Eobard's existence, that should have also undone everything he did. If Eobard doesn't exist he could not have gone back in time to kill Barry's mother. So we end with the same result, only this time we change the past from the present. Obviously the fabric of time didn't agree with that mess. Hence we see a black hole form.

As a law biding, tax paying citizen of Texas, and I was informed that a portion of my refund had been withheld to pay past due child support. Ok look I have no problem with the state stepping in on dead beat dads who would rather spend their money chasing tail than fulfilling their obligations, but that isn't me. I am a full commission employee and my ex wife decided to leave me on my most successful year ever. So I got banged with the max child support she could get. But I have not missed a payment. It feels like, sicne the divorce, I've been living paycheck to paycheck...which is frustrating. Several months I've paid more in child support than I've gotten paid myself, but I have not missed a freakin payment. 

I'm sure you can imagine my RAGE when this message pops up saying that a little over $2 grand was being withheld from my tax refund. To make matters worse, getting ahold of my enforcement officer with the state of Texas is impossible. I'm starting to get a sneaking suspicion that the money is just gone...never to be seen again. Well...no doubt it'll be seen again, by my ex-wife. 

If anyone has had a similar experience, please let me know what to freaking do.


Update: I decided I would call my enforcement officer every 30 minutes or so from office open today. Got him on the phone a little while ago. He explained that the problem existed between when I was paying her directly and when I started paying through the state. We filled out numerous affidavits proving that I had been paying even before I was ordered to. The guy even said, ""appears I have the affidavit in question here, but our system hasn't been updated."" That affidavit was sent in SEPTEMBER. 

What really sucks the most about this situation is there isn't anything I can really do. Has to be worked out between the State of Texas and my ex wife. How is it even possible that I have no claim in this. No forms for me to fill out to prove that I, indeed paid what I was supposed to? In order to prove it I have to rely on my ex wife to bail me out. My ex isn't terrible...we aren't friends but she isn't a complete bitch either. So things like this aren't extremely painful. There has to be a better way than this. ",Tax Refund Withheld Due To Unpaid Child Support...One Problem...I PAY MY FRICKEN CHILD SUPPORT!!!

I have everything coming into the system through an ender chest. The system then filters into a mainlin (green channel) that sorts out all the cobble, dirt, sand, gravel. Then, goes on to sort all the ore blocks...this all happens in Jabba Barrels. The ore barrels can be extracted on a seperate channel that takes them to a row of sag mills to chop'em up...dust gets sorted into a buffer chest that gets put into allow smelters, which then feed ingots back into the mainline. Ingots, dusts and gems are sorted on the next level...also in barrels. I basically have a barrel...or multiples for each mineral based item. At the end of the line I came up with the brilliant idea of never throwing away anything. I'd just use a *Factorization packager to convert sand, gravel, dirt, and cobble into condensed versions and if needed add a second packager to compress those (compressed, sand, cobble, etc) into double compressed. I'm OCD about not throwing stuff in a trash can...can't be helped. 

So here is my problem: Because sand, gravel and dirt all have 2x2 crafting recipes, My system is getting jammed. For the time being I've got an item filter on the input to the packager white listing only cobblestone. Its pretty annoying...and I know there has to be a work around. So I thought I'd ask you guys...you know...the experts. If you had any thoughts on how I can make the BC packager ONLY use the 3x3 crafting recipes.

>*In the last weeks of his life, Richard Valdez told his family and friends that someone was out to kill him.  ""He told me that if he was killed, he would write his name in his own blood - he'd write the name of the guy who did the shooting,"" said his father.  Richard, 25, and his girlfriend, Sharon Condon, 19, were found shot to death in a farmhouse Richard rented near a rural cemetery north of Scottsbluff.  Scrawled on the wall near them, in blood, was the name ""Jeff.""  Sheriff Chuck Fairbanks said that a felony arrest warrant has been issued for a suspect in the case:  Jeff Boppre, 25, of Scottsbluff.*  

[source](http://www.thedarksideofamerica.com/boppre-jeff-ne.html)

&nbsp;

This case is about a September, 1988 double murder in [Scottsbluff, Nebraska](https://www.google.com/search?q=scottsbluff+nebraska&oq=sciottsbluff+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.7836j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 
The 2 murdered were a drug dealer Richard Valdez and his 19 year-old, pregnant girlfriend, Sharon Condon. 

&nbsp;

In his final moments, Valdez may have written the killer's name in a [mixture of blood and grease at the scene](https://imgur.com/a/IGc1N).   

&nbsp;

Not surprisingly given that evidence, the investigation quickly zeroed in on [Jeff Boppre](https://www.facebook.com/groups/326510333156/) a 25 year-old man relatively well-known to local law enforcement.  Boppre turned himself in when he found out there was warrant for his arrest. Boppre admitted being at the residence that evening to purchase cocaine, but went to trial maintaining his innocence.  

&nbsp;

While he wasn't exactly a saint, Boppre had no prior record of particularly violent crimes, which has caused some to question whether or not he actually is guilty.  

&nbsp;

Police would assert that the motive for the murder was drug-related robbery, despite the fact that [$10,000 in cash and drugs](http://www.thedarksideofamerica.com/boppre-jeff-ne.html) still remained in the house to be found by investigators after the murders.

&nbsp;

Boppre and his legal team [maintain his innocence to this day](http://kneb.com/regional-news/convicted-murderer-files-against-scotts-bluff-county-sheriff/) through a variety of legal actions, including attempts to get his conviction overturned in 1990, 1993, and 1997, however...

&nbsp;

The prosecution was able to present an eyewitness, [William Alan Niemann](http://dcs-inmatesearch.ne.gov/Corrections/InmateDisplayServlet?DcsId=39626) who testified to have *seen* Boppre kill Valdez and heard him brag about murdering Condon. 

&nbsp;

And that was enough.

&nbsp;

Boppre was convicted.

&nbsp;

*But...* 

&nbsp;

Niemann was given a reduced sentence in return for his testimony against Boppre, who received two life sentences.

&nbsp;

**and**

&nbsp;

Niemann would later go on to recant his testimony and assert that his statements were the result of coercion and coaching by investigators.  

&nbsp;

For the past three decades, Jeff Boppre has remained in prison for a crime  he and his attorneys continue to argue that he did not commit.  In 2010, they presented DNA evidence which could indicate that the murder may have been committed by Condon's cousin, [John Yellowboy](http://www.denverpost.com/2010/09/25/dna-tests-could-bring-new-trial-in-double-murder/), who was by that time serving a [66 year sentence for rape and kidnapping](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20150116g08).  

&nbsp;

They've also asserted that [prosecutors withheld key evidence](http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/convicted-murderer-claims-misconduct-in-appeal/article_5f82a216-0a2f-5520-99cb-bfa3c8db8a12.html).

&nbsp;

They've raised many questions about Boppre's guilt.  

&nbsp;

An [upcoming documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZnjD8TnDBM) is hoping to shed new light on the case. 

&nbsp; 

[Has an innocent man been in prison for nearly three decades?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlO6qp4iWkQ)

&nbsp;

This case has always interested me because it happened in my home town of Scottsbluff, Nebraska and it's a town of about 15,000 people. So of course we don't have a lot of murders here. So growing up in the community you always hear rumors of how Jeff Boppre was innocent and that he was framed by corrupt law enforcement. 

&nbsp;

As a kid it was a far-fetched story to believe. 

&nbsp;

There was no internet back then so it was all hearsay. Now fast forward 25 years later I worked with a few guys who were talking about this case and looked it up and found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=87&v=jaD_-Cg-Vu8) to refresh my memory a little bit. 

&nbsp;

There's an ongoing discussion about the case on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/isjeffreallyguilty/) which is full of important and interesting information regarding the case.

&nbsp;

So what do you think?

&nbsp;

Is Jeff Boppre guilty?

&nbsp;

Was he simply wrongly convicted?

&nbsp;

Or was he deliberately framed by corrupt law enforcement?

But then one night something occurred to me I hadn't thought of before, and I haven't ever seen discussed anywhere regarding the case.  There seemed to be a little interest in it when I mentioned I was working on a new angle in a reply to the [what's your deepest rabbit hole?](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/56dz8a/what_has_your_deepest_rabbit_hole_case_been/) thread.

So... as promised I thought I'd put it all together and see what everybody else thinks.  

Go ahead and skip on down to the end if you don't want/need to read another summary on this case.  I don't think my analysis is groundbreaking or anything, I simply thought it would be necessary to include the full write-up along with my admittedly flimsy theory just to demonstrate that I *have* done my research and haven't arrived at my current theory lightly (of course, that **still** doesn't mean it's correct).

At first I was going to simply add it as a reply to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/57o7ex/springfield_3_theorizing/) post from /u/itsSweded, but I'd already been working on it for a while and figured it would simply be far too long.

And it hasn't gone away.  

For 25 years since the night of June 7, 1992, someone has been living  with that guilt and anxiety. 
There are people who know what happened to [Suzanne Streeter(19)](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/s/streeter_suzanne.html), [Stacy McCall(18)](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/m/mccall_stacy.html), and Suzie's mother [Sherrill Levitt(47)](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/l/levitt_sherrill.html) after the three disappeared from Sherrill and Suzie's home at [1717 E. Delmar St. in Springfield, MO](http://imgur.com/a/zC9ox) sometime between around 9-11 pm the previous night (reports conflict and no verified phone records are available) when Sherrill was last known to have spoken to a friend on the phone (Suzie and Stacy were last seen leaving a graduation party at their friend Janelle Kirby’s house between 1:30 and 2:30am. They had been expected to stay the night there after a party) and around 8am the next morning when friends of the teen girls arrived to find door unlocked and the house empty except for the dog, a Yorkie named Cinnamon who was found closed up in the bathroom.

The family and friends of these three missing women have spent the past quarter of a century trapped in the agony of not really knowing even a single thing about what happened that night.  
In all that time, there have been no new breakthroughs. No concrete evidence. A mere few shaky, dubious suspects. No productive leads. No significant developments even with advances in technology. 
No known motive, no known means, no known opportunity.
  
In short, [nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gHUqa7aZnE)

Suzie, Sherrill and Stacy might as well have vanished into thin air leaving literally nothing in their wake except questions met with an echoing silence where the answers ought to be.

It is by every sense of the word a pure mystery. 

Since that night, almost *all* of the conversation regarding the fate of these three women has been speculation. Not only because the events leading up to their disappearance occurred in an era before caller identification, cellular phones, text messaging, GPS, and the various other bleeps and bloops we all take for granted leaving in the technological footprint of our everyday life, but also because the police have not been very forthcoming regarding the progress of the case over the past quarter decade, if it has in fact progressed at all.

But amid the official silence of those intervening years, the internet has been rife with theories, gossip, rumors and speculation about what could have happened.  There have been many posts on this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/search?q=springfield&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all), threads on [websleuths](http://www.websleuths.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?325-The-Springfield-Three), [topix](http://www.topix.com/forum/city/springfield-mo/TFD8949PQAGBVD9G2), true crime television such as [Disappeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6r_ADx0fOI), [48 Hours](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rghgb), America‘s Most Wanted, [podcasts,](http://thinkingsidewayspodcast.com/page/13/) countless other true crime [blogs](http://www.truecrimediary.com/index.cfm?page=cases&id=33) and [forums](http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?s=28f2ccda2a9f437eddf39339def1b4b2&t=192695) of varying credibility, dedicated to the case and to finding out what happened to those women that night, where they could have gone and how it could have happened.  

Streeter’s brother Bartt, a once and former suspect in the case (according to some) has a [blog](http://streeterfamilyblogg.blogspot.com/) which he dedicates to “an attempt to assemble public information on the abduction of Sherrill Levitt, Suzanne Streeter, and Stacy McCall.”

Some of the well-worn ""clues"" in the case are known to veteran sleuths and include the much lamented broken porch light 

which was actually [not the bulb itself, but rather the glass covering around the porch light](http://imgur.com/a/9ppSz) 

that was broken and generally accepted to be found the next morning (by Janelle and her boyfriend who cleaned it up and threw the broken glass in the garbage only to be eventually recovered by police as evidence in the case), the apparent disruption of the crime scene by the friends who came looking for this girls the next morning (the number of people who supposedly showed up and “contaminated“ the crime scene rages from 6-20), the lined-up purses, an uncorroborated possible sighting of the trio by a server at George's Steakhouse [less than a mile from the residence](http://imgur.com/a/Em00p), [the green van](http://imgur.com/a/a03yy) supposedly seen being driven by Streeter in an apparent state of duress by a witness who only came forward much later, and an obscene phone message that was accidentally erased.  
The most complete list of people in and out f the house that morning I’ve been able to find is from [websleuths](http://www.websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?159456-Major-Figures-in-Springfield-MW-case)
>Officer Rick Bookout, responded to 1717 E. Delmar after Janis McCall contacted police, along with Officer Brian Gault. Wrote Incidental Report of 6/07/92.

>Janelle Kirby; Mike Henson; Stewart and Janis McCall, and their daughters Meredith and Lisa; Adina Ruthrauff (a friend of Stacy and Suzie) and her mother Darlene; and Janelle's parents Randy and Kathy Kirby. The Tulsa World article states that 18 people had been in and out of the house, although only these 10 were listed in the Incidental Report.

If you know the case, then you know what I’m talking about.  If you’re new to it, then you can find a plethora of information, speculation and outright conjuration regarding these topics for yourself simply by Googling it or checking out some of the above links.
It gets to be a mess the more and more you over-think it, but by all appearances none of these three women had any discernable enemies, let alone the type of enemies who could simply make them disappear without a trace from an ostensibly locked home in the middle of the night without leaving evidence or signs of a struggle.

Or did they?

Records show that Suzie had a former boyfriend arrested alongside others for what amounted to grave robbery occurring on Feb. 21, 1992.   Suzie had given a statement to officers with regard to the case on March 5, 1992 and may or may not have been scheduled to testify as a witness in the upcoming trial (I've been unable to find confirmation one way or the other).
  
Now, it’s debatable as to whether or not this was a semi-innocent act committed by misguided teens or something darker. But by all accounts, three boys had been caught vandalizing a mausoleum, stealing a skull, and attempting to sell said skull’s golden fillings to a local pawn shop.

Does that mean that they could be somehow involved with the disappearance of not only Suzie, but her mother and a random friend as well?
  
It's possible, but personally, I don't think so.  

Clearly they were not master criminals, and they were all subsequently cleared by police.  Although, some report that (at least) one of them was ""cleared"" very informally, by the chief of police himself, allegedly over coffee at a local restaurant. This only fueled subsequent internet fires over how well the police were able to handle the case from the beginning.  Some sources even use quotes from the chief himself to show that the investigation was tumultuous and embattled from the outset.

>Former Police Chief Terry Knowles micromanaged the case and questioned possible suspects himself. Information obtained was not properly shared among the investigators, Webb says.

>""The whole case was so unusual in the way it was conducted,"" he said. ""It became a very politically charged environment, and people started taking sides. [It] was not only an emotional ride for the family but [also] for the investigators. It was also a career-ender for some of the officers, and I was one.

>""I didn't quit or get fired, [but] I ended up getting reassigned because of disagreements over the way the case was going.""

>Webb is not the only person connected to the case who has spoken about problems in the investigation. In 2002, George Larbey, former president of the Springfield Police Officers Association, told the Springfield News-Leader that detectives did not think Knowles had confidence in them.

>""If your highest command tells you how it's going to be, simply put, that's how it's going to be,"" Larbey said. ""Detectives felt powerless. ... The newer guys wouldn't have any idea what was going on, that this wasn't normally the way we did business.

>""Knowles, who is retired, could not be reached for comment. But he gave an interview to the same reporter for a story about the 10th anniversary of the disappearance. He acknowledged being heavily involved in the case.

>""I don't recall that being an issue back then,"" he said then about the criticism. ""What anyone wants to say 10 years later -- I can't control that. It's certainly disappointing, and it's frustrating at the time to be doing everything you possibly can.

Of course, this is a theory largely purported by news sources as “credible” as [The Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364608/TV-sparks-dozen-tips-women-vanished-trace-18-years-ago.html) and first put forward by user Ken on the websleuths forum who happily states that he received the tip as part of a psychic encounter with the spirit of Stacy McCall.  Personally, I think the hospital theory has zero credibility given knowledge of its origin.  But of course, I am neither a professional investigator nor a professional psychic, so of course I could be wrong.  

So, let's look at some statements from Websleuth Ken...

>*There are millions of people missing...not thousands.* 
>*Imagine looking at a blue marble in a fish tank. You can ""see"" the blue marble through the glass and through the water. The frequency of light from the blue marble is different from it's surroundings, so you can easily see it. The principle used to find the 3MW is similar in approach. It's called [Micro Impulse Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropower_impulse_radar). It can ""see"" through concrete because everything has a unique resonating frequency, including Mercury. Mercury is found in teeth fillings. When Tim Gray did his initial scan, his instrument picked up a signal unique for Mercury. Tim's instrument is unique in that it can detect resonating frequencies from considerable distances away and be able to pinpoint an objects exact location. This is the technology that found the three missing women at the parking garage.* 
>*Tim's instrument is a prototype and it's not mainstream technology. It's a Pandora's Box in that if this technology were to go mainstream, there won't be anywhere to hide. Privacy will become a thing of the past. There is alot more at stake here with the Parking Garage dig than you can possibly even imagine.* 
>*This is what you missed out on while you were sleeping in ignore mode. When this case breaks, you won't have to worry about eating your words; you will be asleep in ignore mode as usual. Pleasant dreams!*

[source](http://www.websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?8961-The-Springfield-Three-missing-since-June-1992-1/page14&pp=25).  

as well as

>*When the authorities dig up the concrete at the parking garage and they find the three missing women; Stacy McCall will make history. Stacy will have done what Harry Houdini failed to do...prove the existence of life after death.* 
>*Even though I experienced a life changing vision with her in November of 1998, it was an uncomfortable and painful experience. She made it perfectly clear to me that she is furious.* 

>*Mrs. McCall has stated in the media that she believes her daughter could be alive. When the dig takes place at the parking garage; it will prove Mrs. McCall right. Just not in the way that she thinks.* 
>*There is an old saying: ""Dead men tell no tales."" That myth is one that will soon be busted.* 
>*Ken*

advocated by users such as ""Starlight""

>*Miles Draken said -- in part -- ""so we can find out how wrong all these conspiracy theories and visions were. But, I guess everyone will just find new interpretations for them. Like Nostrodamus' predictions the events are predicted only in hindsight.""*
>*Guess you watched the episode on Nostradamus over the week-end too! However, Ken Young's 'vision' has not been left up to humanity to 'interpret.' His vision[s] have been interpreted, not in 'hindsight' as you so boldly accuse, but far in advance of the discovery of these women. The location has already been named, along with the time period. Notice he said he could see the number in his vision. April is the fourth month of the year. That's when the first scan took place. 
>There will be no 'new interpretations' for anything that is posted on my web site concerning this case or any other case.
>A 'prediction' is something given in advance. If it pan's out [comes true] then it becomes a fulfillment of a prediction. There's enough information posted concerning this vision, and enough people have read it to know if it 'comes true, then there's no 'hindsight' involved in it.
>I designed an entire web site because of this very type of accusation. I cannot speak for anyone else, but I do NOT have a history or a reputation for coming along after the fact and claiming credit for other people's work. That's not my style.*
>*And as far as everyone getting tired of this type of conversation -- what do you have contribute?*
>**The ""Stacy Vision Theory"" is the best bet in nearly 15 years. It gives more answers than anything before, or since.** 
>*And, lest you forget -- there's been two 'scientific' scans conducted in the area, that seem to confirm there's something there, so I wouldn't say everything is 'psychic.' We've already verified the 'psychic' portions, and that's no longer debatable. What Miles Draken [and others] are bickering over at this point, and trying to debunk is actually scientifically accepted results that are used in many, many areas for various purposes! 
>Pray tell -- what will you say when the vision, the interpretation and the tests pan-out, and the women are precisely where we said they are?*

and investigative reporter/blogger Kathee Baird who [petitioned](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/dig-up-cox-Springfield) semi-successfully to have that particular area searched and whose blog [“The Crime Scene”](http://crimesceneinvestigations.blogspot.com/) I have referenced in this write-up.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8DKyRK27pM) is some video of the attempt to use the radar, or possibly a similar type of radar at the parking garage.  

It’s reported that “anomalies have been found” on the radar, but nothing has been concretely (sorry for the pun) proven and the topic remains heavily debated online.

Many also seem to think that the coincidentally-named [Robert Craig Cox](https://militaryjusticeforall.com/tag/robert-craig-cox/), an army ranger and former Soldier of the Year with a [complicated legal history](http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Court-Orders-Innocent-Verdict-For-Soldier-of-The-Year-/id-2a5de9d5938363b3541a7e8d3c158957) (to say the least) who is currently imprisoned for an unrelated crime may have been involved. He is reported to have been in the area at the time and may have had a tangential connection to Stacy McCall's father by virtue of working at the same business for a period of time.  He has made some fairly cryptic statements regarding the case, but has so far produced nothing of significant value and may simply be seeking attention.

Another known person of interest is Steve Garrison, who is currently serving a 40 year sentence for an [unrelated crime](http://mo.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19960711_0001.mo.htm/qx).  Garrison reportedly gave police information allegedly unknown to the public regarding the green van and three murdered women, but it [did not pan out after police searched](http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2015/06/05/pokin-around-missing-women-suddenly/28565325/).

>Garrison told police a friend had confessed to killing the three women during a drunken party. He told police information unknown to the public that led investigators to serve three search warrants at two sites in western Webster County; that they would find the women’s bodies and clues about their abduction and deaths. He also said a moss green van believed used to take the women would be found about 12 miles away, south of Fordland.

>The property searched was the same site where in 1990 LE searched for two of three missing Springfieldians. Property owner Francis Lee Robb Sr. pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder in a case authorities said at the time they believed involve a drug deal gone awry.
Garrison was believed enough that a gag order concerning the three search warrants was issued by a judge.“…certain aspects of the information we received fit with other (private) aspects of the case,” Springfield Police Capt. Todd Whitson said. Whitson said the gag order was rare, but he could not say why it was issued,“other than to say there is such an order, and it governs the operation and everything related to the operation out here.” Added Webster County Sheriff C.E. Wells:“We can’t tell you anything about it until the order’s lifted.”


The source of the above quote is fairly comprehensive list of people generally considered to be potential (and **publicly named**) persons of interest. It can be found at [the streeter family blog](http://streeterfamilyblogg.blogspot.com/p/person-of-interest.html) which is maintained by Bartt Streeter.  

There is also the curiosity of the so-called GJ3.  Three men allegedly named before a grand jury with regard to their involvement in the case.  However, no charges were brought, and the records are sealed by the court leading to much speculation online.

I could go on and on, but so far it hasn't gotten me anywhere.

#**KNOWN UNKNOWNS**

Well, none of the proposed answers have so far yielded much in the way of results, so for my own  investigation I figured that if I can’t trust the answers, then maybe I could at least trust the *questions*. 

So, now I'm back to the beginning, asking that same question.  

**'What's the simplest, most boring way that this could have happened?'** 

After years of reading on the case, I might not have learned anything new, but at least I know what I *don't* know.

*How could someone(s) have gotten those three women out of the house that night without leaving a trace of evidence or sign of a struggle?*

*Did they impersonate an authority figure to gain entry?*

*Did they fabricate some type of emergency in order to get the women to comply?*

*Did they have a weapon they used to control them?*

*How could they have been transported from the house in a vehicle, likely against their will, without arousing suspicion or attracting attention while the perpetrator(s) were still able to drive the vehicle and prevent the three women from escaping or calling for help?*

*Why have the police put forward almost nothing even a quarter century after that night?*

Ok, so after all that here's my flimsy, two-word answer for all of it:

**cop car**.

An armed, uniformed officer arriving at the house that night in a squad car literally answers every single question I've ever had about 

*how they could have been taken quickly and quietly without leaving any evidence of an intruder*

*why they even opened the door in the first place*

*why the dog was locked up* 

*how they could they have been taken without signs of a struggle* 

*why they left without most of their important belongings, including keys, purses, and cigarettes*

*how they could be so easily controlled by one perpetrator in transit* 

*how they could be transported in a vehicle they'd be unlikely to escape from*   

*why has no one made a single peep in the past 25 years and there has not been much progress in the investigation*
 
It's such a stupidly simple answer that *even I* think it has to be wrong.  

But it makes a kind of sense I'm having trouble shaking, so I'm interested in what you all have to say.

I don't typically go for the ""cops had to have been in on it"" type theories but after everything else is gone, you have to look at what's left, and right now it's the only thing I've got that explains all the answers *and* all the questions.

Of course, it's only my theory about *how* it could have happened, and does absolutely nothing to determine the *who* or more importantly, the *why*... which I admit I don't have even the slightest clue about.

If it happened like this, it had to be related to *something*, although I have no idea what, which means if I want to continue this line of reasoning, I have to start looking into everything else that went on around there *except* what happened to those women that night because maybe *that's* where the answer is.

And that'll be the brand-new part of the rabbit hole I'm gonna have to dig for myself if I want to keep going. 

Anyway, I guess I'll close with one of the quotes I opened with, from one of the only FBI agents ever to speak publicly about the case.  

See if it sounds different to you now.

>*""If you look into the records of missing persons every year, you would not come across many cases like this""...*

>*""I think they (other people) were brought into this not knowing what was going to happen. It's quite possible that the primary person did not know what was going to happen""...*

>*""There are people that have knowledge who don't feel good about the knowledge they have. They may not be the primary person""....*  

>*""The abduction leader probably was an acquaintance 'who may have known their comings and goings'""*  

>*""Secondary players may fear going to police because they think the primary culprit would retaliate.""  

>*""But anyone withholding information probably is feeling strong anxiety...""* 

>*""If you think you don't feel good about it now, don't think it's going to get any better. Don't think it's going to go away.""*

#The intrepid crew of the StarShip WeirdThings is attempting its first ever landing...

\[INT:  Cockpit of Space X Shuttle rapidly hurtling toward Earth]

**Andrew**:	*(fiddling with all manner of switches, dials, knobs and levers)* We’re going way out of control here guys, we’re definitely going to crash.

**JuRY:**		Andrew, you PROMISED us that you knew how to fly this thing!  
		Remember? Before we launched? I *specifically* asked you if you knew how to fly this thing?  And you said yes?!

**Andrew:**	Fly? Yes.  Land? No.

**JuRY:**		Oh for fuck’s sake, no Indiana Jones, ok?

**Andrew:**	Hey, I’m making this up as I go along.

**JuRY:**		Oh cram it up your ass Indy.

**Shwood:**	*(Pressing and re-pressing everything)* BUTTONS!  There’s so many 
		buttons!

**JuRY:**		*(radio mic in hand)* They’re still not answering!  Mission control, this is 
		soon-to-be-smoking crater #1 how do you copy?

*static from radio* *(grumbling)*  Seriously, you have got to be shitting me.

**Andrew:**	*(fumbling through compartments and looking underneath things)* WHY 			didn’t anybody think to put an instruction manual in this thing?!

**JuRY:**		Because it’s $10,000 a pound to get shit up here and that manual probably 
		weighs as much as your mother. Also, mission control is supposed to be 
		able to talk us through anything that could happen over the radio.

**Andrew:**	*(glaring and dripping with sarcasm)* Yeah? Well how’s that going so far?  			You know how much NASA spent to make that space-writing pen when 			the Russians just used a pencil?


**JuRY:**		You do know that story’s not true, right?

**Andrew:**	I know I was making a point that sometimes simpler is…

**JuRY:**		It’s apocryphal.

**Andrew:**	I KNOW!

**Shwood:**	Hey! Is that an Apollo 13 reference?

**Andrew:**	What Brian?

**Shwood:** 	WHY are you guys making movie references to Apollo 13 at a time like 			this?! That movie’s 20 years old and we’re all going to die!

**Andrew:**	I’d think “we have to science the SHIT out of this” from 					the Martian would have been a much more topical reference, so that‘s 			the one I would have made.  IF I was going make MOVIE REFERENCES 
		at a time like this!.

**JuRY:**		Well, science faster Mayne! Come in mission control Andrew’s being a 			space-douche and we’re STILL going to crash.  Into Earth apparently.
		Over.

*static*

**Shwood:**	There’s no way in fuck I’d be quoting Matt Damon in a time like this.  

**JuRY:**		Must science faster, must science faster.

**Shwood:**	I’m sciencing as fast as I can, ok?!  *(returns to flipping random switches 			and buttons)*  See?!  SEE?!  BUTTONS AND SWITCHES!

**JuRY:**		None of this  is a fucking movie reference Spiro!  This is a real-life 
		scenario!  We are in a spaceship, and we’re about to crash into the Earth.  			The planet where we live!

**Shwood:**	AND where we’ll die!  IRONY!!! AM I RIGHT!!!

**Andrew:**	*(sighing)* All right, I’ve accepted my fate.  Can we at least just die in peace
		And quiet?!

**Shwood:**	Did you just fucking call me Spiro!  It’s my most hated of all roles. 
		*(mumbles)* those short shorts were so demeaning.  *(Begins to quietly weep)*

**Andrew:** *(sullenly to himself)* No.  Of course not, I‘m going to have to die listening 
		to this.	

**JuRY:**		Yeah, well we’re going to all be vaporized in about 5 minutes, so what the 
		hell are you going to do about it Mister Short Pants?  Come in, mission 			control, we have lost critical uh, space-shippy functions and Spiro… I 			mean  Brian probably has space herpes too.  Come in.  Over.

*static*

**Andrew:**	Actually, it’s more like 3 and a half minutes.  You know, until we’re dead.

**Shwood:**	What am I gonna do about it? WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT IT?! 			How about I steer this thing right into your house and we all die that way?  
		Huh?  HUH?!  HAHA!  Fuck you, The Fudge!


**JuRY:**	Oh, how about your mother Brian?  How about that?!  Mission control we 
		Have confirmation.  It’s space herpes.  All over his face.  Spread to his 
		brain.  How do you  copy?  Over.

static


**Andrew:**  Guys, this is not the time to be fighting.  This is the time to be figuring out 		how to save my life.  I’ll gladly accept whatever sacrifices you two need to 		make for that to happen.  I’ll dedicate my next book to you and, uh… your 
		grieving families too.  I guess.  “Andrew Mayne: Space Hero!”  I've already outlined the first two chapters.  Do you wanna check it out? *(Turns from controls with fistful of scrawlings on ripped-out notebook paper which slips out of his hand and begins to float away in the zero-gravity environment)*  NO!  My masterpiece!!

**JuRY:**		Wait, the sacrifices WE need to make?

**Andrew:**	…Or have made *for* you.  Whatever.  Oh my God Brian what are you 
		doing?

**Shwood:** *(Has ripped part of the control panel off and is now holding a fistful of sparking wires)*  THERE’S SO MANY WIRES IN HERE!

**ALARM:**	CRITICAL FAILURE OF OXYGEN SYSTEM!!!

**JuRY:**		Whose bright idea was it give us a spaceship anyway?  Over.

*static*

**Andrew:**	One of these levers has to be the one you pull if you want to go up. You’d
		Think they’d be labeled better.  If only someone had made a manual I 
		could reference.

**Shwood:**	Andrew!  You’re supposed to be smarter than us!  Do SOMETHING 
		THAT MAKES US SURVIVE THIS!

**Andrew:**	I didn’t design this lousy user interface Brian.

**JuRY:**		*(Giving Shwood death-stare)*  For fucks sake, STOP PULLING 
		OUT  WIRES!!!

**ALARM:**	OXYGEN SYSTEM SOMEHOW REPAIRED?

**Shwood:**	Ha! See!  My plan’s better than yours, mister ‘oooh, let me call tech 
		support’.

**Andrew:**	Guys, we have to do something. That  PLANET is STILL coming right 
		toward us.  

**Shwood:**	“ground control to Major Tom..”

**(Andrew and Justin simultaneously)**  SHUT UP!!

**Justin:**		*(sighing)*  Ground control, this is Major Tom do you copy?  Over.

*static*

**Andrew:**	Ok guys, we’re almost out of time, where do we want to try and land this 			thing?	

**Shwood:**	Earth!

**JuRY:**		Oh, fuck you.

**Shwood:**	Fuck *me?*

**JuRY:**		Yeah, what kind of lazy-ass bullshit answer is that?  Not. Even. Funny!  			Going for the super-obvious, ‘duh, let’s land on the planet that’s about to 
		splatter our faces”  I’m Brian ’no-shit’ Brushwood.  Seriously, it’s that 			kind of weak-ass shit that…

**Shwood:**	OK, how about…. COLUMBIA!  Oh, do you have a better idea?  Huh?  			Well, then it looks like we have a CHALLENGER!

**JuRY;**		Jesus Christ, that is so fucking inappropriate.  Especially when you’re 
		CHEWING ON RANDOM WIRES!

**Andrew:**	Guys… I hate to interrupt, but (grabs random lever and begins jostling it maniacally)

**JuRY:**		Good! You remembered which one of those things steers?

**Andrew:**	Uh, sure. *(jostling intensifies)*

**JuRY:**		Ok, we have no way to contact mission control, what’s a good place to 
		land?

**Andrew:**	Ok, whoever got the best grades in geography should probably decide.

**Shwood:**	NOT the World Trade Center.  Definitely.  Total party foul.

**Andrew:**	Holy crap Brian.

**JuRY:**		Did you just say party foul?

**Shwood:**	Yeah.  I did.  Fuck you.  *(Pulls more fistfuls of wires from panel, gnaws on 		them as they spark.)*

**ALARM:**	AUTO CRASH SEQUENCE ENGAGED,  JIHADI MODE ACTIVATED 		PREPARE TO DIE!  

**JuRY:**		Oh, that is wrong on so many levels.

**Shwood:**	*(with mouthful of sparking wires)* WHA?

**Andrew:**	*(Furiously tightening seatbelts)* Uh…. Uh…. Oh……… shiiiiiiit.

**ALARM:**	HAHA.  JUST FUCKING WITH YOU.  AUTO-LAND SEQUENCE
		ENGAGED.  THANK YOU FOR FLYING SPACE X.

**JuRY:**		What? There’s an auto-land?  For the love of Christ Brian let go of the 			wires!  Don’t touch anything else and we might live!

**Andrew:**	*(coughing)*  Of course there‘s an auto-land.  I knew that the whole time, 
		heh-heh. *(eyes dart nervously from side to side)*.

**Shwood:**	Did you know there was a *jihadi* mode too?  Because that seems you know, dangerous and more than just a little bit racist.  Either way, definitely something you should have told us about.

**Andrew:**	The robot voice said it was a joke Brian.  Get over it.  


**And that's where it ended.**

I think he *did* have a backpack with him when he checked in (the clerk thinks maybe he did) but he didn't want it found with him, so he took the money out to keep it secure with him in the room and stashed the bag in a place nearby where no one would likely find it....in the crawlspace underneath the room.  

If so, there's a slim chance it might still be there, of course probably in a severely damaged and weathered state.

Now, for who I think we should root for, in descending importance:

* **Patriots over Steelers:** If we win, we control our own destiny for home field advantage. If we lose, we *cannot* get home field advantage.
* **Texans over Jaguars:** Jacksonville wins all ties with us, and they're only a game back. If we slip up, we need a Jaguars loss in order to get a bye.
* **Titans over 49ers:** In addition to getting us a better pick from the Jimmy G trade, a Titans win helps us in a potential 11-5 tie. If the Jaguars win their next two games and we lose two of our last three, we would be seeded behind the AFC South champion Jaguars, but ahead of the AFC South champion Titans. This means we likely want the Titans to win the South.
* **Dolphins over Bills?:** As mentioned above, this clinches us the division. However, it's questionable as to whether we actually *want* this, as it may push the easy-to-beat Bills out of the playoffs.
* **Browns over Ravens?:** Clinches us a playoff berth and can theoretically help the position of the Jimmy G pick, but rooting for 0-16 would be the evil thing to do, so I'm a bit conflicted. Would *denying* 0-16 be a better thing to root for?
* **Raiders over Cowboys?:** The Chiefs' win yesterday brought them to 8-6 and the cusp of a division title. It's a long shot at this point, but if the Raiders win out and the Chiefs lose out, the Chiefs will likely miss the playoffs. Kansas City's recent struggles shouldn't be overlooked, but they did beat us in Week 1, so keeping them out could be an advantage.
* **Saints over Jets?:** Fuck the Jets. This also helps prevent the Panthers from winning the NFC South, and we know how much trouble Carolina can give us.",Who Should We Root For? (2017 Week 15)

As a reminder, our magic number for the division is 0.5, so the Bills would need to win out and us lose out for us to not win the division.

* **Patriots over Dolphins (MNF):** The odds are against us winning out, but for now, we need to focus on Miami.
* **Ravens over Steelers (SNF):** If all goes right, this allows us to clinch home field a week early. It will also help eliminate the Bills and/or Jets before we play them, leading those teams into tank mode.
* **Seahawks over Jaguars; Cardinals over Titans:** The AFC South teams are creeping up on the #2 spot, and would hold a tiebreaker over us if they win out and we lose twice.

This Thanksgiving is a bit different from the past two from a Patriots fan's perspective, because five of the six teams playing are from the NFC and none of those five affect our strength of victory. (Speaking of strength of victory, we can still reasonably go to SoV with the Jaguars, but we have a solid lead in that tiebreaker. I'll examine that scenario, plus a three-way SoV with the Jaguars and Steelers, in Saturday's post.)

Instead, we should root for the strong NFC teams to lose, to improve our Super Bowl chances. Going down the games one by one:

**VIKINGS @ LIONS (12:30pm, CBS)**

* **Impact for Vikings:** A win helps them lock up the division, though they can't clinch this week. A loss hurts them in the chase for a bye.
* **Impact for Lions:** A win keeps them in the division race, and keeps them in control of their destiny for a playoff berth. A loss significantly hurts their wild card chances.
* **Impact for Other NFC Teams:** Most important game of the week in the NFC playoff picture. A Lions win helps the other NFC division leaders in the race for a first-round bye, but a Vikings win helps the wild card contenders.
* **Impact for AFC Strength of Victory:** None. The Steelers beat both teams, so the outcome of this game doesn't affect their SoV.
* **Who Should We Root For?:** Lions. It's better for us if Detroit gets a wild card instead of one of the other contenders.

**CHARGERS @ COWBOYS (4:30pm, FOX)**

* **Impact for Chargers:** A win keeps them in the wild card race with an outside shot at a division title, and with the AFC as top-heavy as it is, they could easily sneak into the playoffs at 10-6 or even 9-7.
* **Impact for Cowboys:** A win keeps them in the wild card race, but they'll be on the outside looking in no matter what happens this week.
* **Impact for Other AFC Teams:** Minimal. A Chargers win hurts the other #6 seed contenders, but that's about it.
* **Impact for Other NFC Teams:** Almost zero. The Cowboys are too far behind for this game to have an immediate impact.
* **Impact for AFC Strength of Victory:** Minimal. A Chargers win would mutually help both us and the Jaguars in a three-way SoV with the Steelers.
* **Who Should We Root For?:** Chargers. It seems odd to be rooting for an AFC team in an inter-conference game, but the Cowboys could be a legitimate threat in the NFC. However, there's a more important point here: the Chargers' win keeps them in contention longer, which helps assure they won't tank Week 15 against the Chiefs.

**GIANTS @ REDSKINS (8:30pm, NBC)**

* **Impact for Giants:** A win or tie ensures they can't be eliminated this week, but at this point they need to think about draft position.
* **Impact for Redskins:** At 4-6, the Redskins need help even if they win out. A loss wouldn't mathematically eliminate them, but they can't afford to lose the games they should be winning.
* **Impact for Other NFC Teams:** None. Neither of these teams is likely to reach .500, much less a playoff berth.
* **Impact on AFC Strength of Victory:** Minimal. The Chiefs beat the Redskins but lost to the Giants, so they'd prefer a Redskins win. However, because they beat us H2H, it's unlikely it matters to us.
* **Who Should We Root For?:** NBC to air *Heidi* and spare us from watching this atrocity.

---
**Cleveland** can be eliminated from **home field advantage** with MIA win + BUF win.

The Browns have a bye this week, but that doesn't save them from having an elimination scenario.

Because the Browns already have 7 conference losses and no H2H win over an AFC East opponent, they will need the AFC East champion to either be 7-8-1 or worse overall *or* 8-8 with a 5-7 or worse conference record.

MIA win + BUF win mathematically guarantees the AFC East champion will reach 8-8 or better; the worst conference record would be NE at 5-7, but the Patriots would win the tiebreaker on common games.

---

Proof that a BUF win is required (contrary to what PlayoffStatus says):

MIA win + BUF tie requires the non-Jets AFC East teams to lose all games except against each other, which gives KC 8 wins, 6 of which are in the conference.

However, that isn't sufficient for an elimination! The Browns would have H2H wins over JAX and LAC, and if those two teams can get to 8-8 without another team passing them, the Browns can still get the #1 seed.

There are three other all-AFC games in Week 9: Bengals @ Jaguars, Colts @ Texans, and Ravens @ Titans. However, by changing later weeks' results, it can be shown that [none of those games matter](https://playoffpredictors.com/Football/CustomLeague/SchedulePicker/1f8f57dd-231b-4d5b-8d41-b016ce542935/?L=EzCMLdOlT8GLJe9nIejaMXVPOPFIxNKVciBAZgAYH4Hm7rsXWVoPIalgOdCjkGdYMAS1iVwg7BTAdUeURyA) - however those games go, the Browns can still get home field unless the Bills win.

---

**San Francisco** can be eliminated from **home field advantage** with loss/tie.

In this scenario, the 49ers can at best finish 7-8-1 with a conference record of 0-7-1. Due to tiebreakers, they need every division champion to either be 7-9 or worse overall *or* the Giants/Bears at 7-8-1 *or* 7-8-1 with a 4-7-1 or worse conference record.

The NFC simply has too many guaranteed wins going around for this to be possible.

---

**San Francisco** can be eliminated from **first-round bye** with loss.

This is simply a variant of the above scenario. There are too many wins going around in the NFC to get a 7-9 team with 8 conference losses into a bye.

---

**San Francisco** can be eliminated from **first-round bye** with tie + LAR win + NO win + SEA win.

Another variant of the HFA elimination scenario. The LAR/SEA wins force PHI to win a game somewhere down the line (bringing PHI to 8 wins), and the NO win forces an NFC North/South intersection where one team of the group has to get to 8 wins.

---

**San Francisco** can be eliminated from **NFC West** with loss + LAR win + SEA win.

The 49ers will have 9 losses, and if the Week 15 LAR@SEA game has a winner, that team will have 7 wins and the tiebreaker. It then follows that the Rams and Seahawks have to tie each other and otherwise lose out... but in that case, the Cardinals will have 7 wins themselves and an H2H sweep of the 49ers.",Week 9 Elimination Scenarios

Now, here's the problem: if we take the seasons as evidence of the passage of time, it's been almost a year since Beacon fell. Obviously, this means Haven students should have returned by now... so why has there been no indication of Sun returning to the academy?

* The first possibility is a cop-out at best: it's possible Mistral uses the Southern Hemisphere seasons and it's only been six months. Note that Ruby's birthday means that Vale has to be on Northern Hemisphere seasons. It's also worth noting that the map we've been given of their relative locations does *not* bust this theory.
* The second possibility is that Blake and Sun's ongoing arc takes place much earlier than we've been led to believe. This was somewhat reasonable after Volume 4 due to the lack of any decent place to put a timeskip. Unfortunately, this very episode just provided a loose timeline that busts the theory.
* The third possibility is that Miles and Kerry fucked up somehow. They probably didn't expect someone to reconstruct the show's timeline.",[SPOILERS FOR V5E3] Passage of time since the Battle of Beacon

* Big battery so awesome battery life

* god damn is it fat and heavy

* Super usable and sleek  
* easy to maneuver and hold  
* fits easily in pockets  
* still has the same great wide angle camera as 8+

Any takers? 13 years old, big, sweet, has lived with another cat for several years. His name is Shadow. I hate to see him end up at a shelter (assuming we can even find one that will take him, no luck so far). 🙁 Even if someone is willing to temporarily foster him, my wife and I will help find a new home for him. And we'll gladly help cover any costs to get him setup like litter box, food, etc.

Let me know ASAP please! PM me so we can trade phone numbers.

Or any other info you can provide to help him find a new home would be appreciated.  

----

**UPDATE 1 @ 6pm 6/17**  
Well the neighbor has officially left, but not before the cat escaped outside. So instead of us having a cat in our house to foster to a new family, now we have to trap him first. He's freaked out because his human just abandoned him, running loose outside, wet from the rain. He used to be an indoor-outdoor cat, so he knows what to do and is staying close to the house, but he's scared right now and we can't get close to catch him. We put out some water and food under the porch awning. Kinda ticked off at our (ex)neighbor for being irresponsible like this.  

----

**UPDATE 2 @ 3:30PM 6/19**  
Kittah is still roaming outside. I saw him once yesterday morning and he was wet 🙁. I've been leaving out food and water under a covered porch at his [ex-]home and it's going away, so I assume he's eating it. I found one person willing to foster him, but I don't have any leads on a new home for him yet, and we still have to catch him. He'll probably have fleas at this point so that's a worry. A pretty shitty situation still.",Need a new home for sweet cat!

Absolutely terrible. It's made me feel depressed and hopeless; scared about my future. My current path is not sustainable. The only solution I can think of is to disconnect and somehow not pay attention.

Step 1 today was to deactivate Twitter. Even with a tightly-culled feed of cool, non-political, happy things, it's too easy to see the shitstorms that are trending and get sucked into the depressing abyss. So I'm done with Twitter.

Alternatively, Flipboard allows me to have a feed of good news like scientific discoveries, Android development, the tech world, etc. -- things I enjoy. But I will miss being able to interact with authors and thought-leaders on Twitter.

I've set filters in Reddit to hopefully keep political news out of my browsings.

But what's next? Delete Facebook? I'm scared of that one because of all of the family connections and photos of nephews, etc. I don't want to miss out on. But damn straight that's where a lot of frustration comes from -- and it's terrible for my relationships with others.

I don't know what to do really. Paying attention hurts. But not paying attention to something you feel so passionately about is a cop-out. Both sides of the coin are evil.

I've taken a liking to minimalist philosophies, and my wife is very supportive of that, which helps. I think there is a way forward there.

So let's talk about him.  A lot of this will just be rehashed from what I've said across multiple threads, but I figured I'd try and coalesce into one post.

Hurts is 24-2 as a starter, including a 15-1 conference record, a conference championship, and a playoff win. He's third (I believe, could be second, though) in touchdowns in school history. Our offense is 2nd in the SEC in scoring offense and rushing offense (and only by tenths of a point/yard in each category) and 3rd in total offense.  As a true freshman, he was the SEC Offensive Player of the Year.  

He's 11-1 this season with TWO turnovers in over 600 snaps.  That's after nine interceptions and at least two fumbles lost last season.  That's a huge improvement, and not turning the ball over is so crucial.  While the offense may have struggled to move the ball and extend drives, which put the defense on the field a lot, the offense rarely left the defense in a bad position.  Not turning the ball over and letting J.K. Scott boom the ball and flip the field gives the defense more field to work with and forces the opposing offense to have to drive farther.

Saban wants his quarterbacks to limit mistakes.  Past Bama QBs, rightly or wrongly, often were tagged with the infamous ""game manager"" label.  Even with his game-changing ability, Hurts could accurately be described as a ""game manager"" now.  

I have seen multiple people complaining about his lack of turnovers, basically saying they wish he had more interceptions because it would mean he was taking more chances to push the ball downfield.  I understand the argument, but I think it's a little crazy.  

Hurts' passing stats won't wow anybody (not playing in the 4th quarter of most games this season doesn't help), but he has improved.  His yards per attempt, [which I brought up before the season](https://www.reddit.com/r/rolltide/comments/5nklmp/improvement_in_yardsattempt_from_1st_year/), has made a big jump.  In 2016, Hurts averaged 7.3 yards/attempt.  In 2017, he's averaging 8.7 yards/attempt.  As you can see, Greg McElroy and AJ McCarron each improved by 1.3 yards/attempt in their second year starting; Hurts has improved by 1.4 yards/attempt with one or two games remaining.

His completion percentage has gone down, 62.8% to 60.8%; but Hurts is also throwing far fewer passes behind the line of scrimmage.  The jet sweeps, essentially runs that counted as passes, from Kiffin's days are almost entirely gone.

Hurts' quarterback rating also jumped up from 139.12 to 155.62.  That ranks him 15th in the entire country.  

While he has improved, Hurts still reverts to his old habits sometimes.  Yes, pass protection has been inconsistent for most of the season; but Hurts will still bail from the pocket too soon, often because his first read is covered.   Now, sometimes this is what he's supposed to do on the play; but he can't fall back on that for every time he does it.  

Some of this can be attributed to the fact that the offense really only has one reliable wide receiver.  While Robert Foster and Cam Sims can make the occasional play, they haven't shown they can be relied on this season.  Players like Jerry Jeudy, Devonta Smith, and Henry Ruggs ooze talent; but they are still just true freshman.

But that is what it is.  Hurts understandably locks in on Calvin Ridley, but this focus can hurt the rest of the offense.  Opposing teams can scheme to take away Ridley, which is a tough task; and this limits what Hurts does through the air.  

Can Hurts improve more?  Sure.  He definitely could.  However, the majority quarterbacks show the most improvement from Year 1 to Year 2; so, like it or not, what we have now may basically be what we'll see from Hurts the rest of his career.  Again, I'm not saying he won't improve at all.  There could be small changes for the better.  And hey, maybe he'll take another huge step forward.  But it's no guarantee.

So.  Is this enough?  

In the two losses, Hurts wasn't the sole reason for the loss.  Playcalling, injuries, pass protection issues, and penalties all played a role.  Hurts does share some of the blame, though; and while it's to be expected, he has struggled against top tier opponents.

The calls for Tua Tagovailoa to play over Hurts *this* season were and are absurd.  Alabama had an electrifying returning starter at quarterback, not an open quarterback competition like when Hurts won as a true freshman.  

Tagovailoa has flashed oodles of talent in his limited playing time.  He *looks* like he'll be a better passer than Hurts, and he doesn't appear to be a slouch running the ball either.  But we just don't *know*.  

Tagovailoa has not played unless Alabama was up by at least 15 points.  Let me say that again.  Tagovailoa has not played in a game where Alabama was tied.  He has not played in a game where Alabama was up by 1-7 points.  He has not played in a game where Alabama was up by 8-14 points.  He has not played with any sort of real pressure.

Tagovailoa has looked really good when he's played during blowouts.  66% completion percentage, 8 touchdowns to 1 interception, and 8.9 yards/attempt.  He's also rushed 15 times (including sacks) for 106 yards and 2 touchdowns.  His absurd touchdown pass to Devonta Smith against Vanderbilt made everyone excited for the future.

Still, Tagovailoa is just a true freshman going against an entrenched starter, who, with flaws, is still a really damn good quarterback.  Tagovailoa was never going to start this season without an injury.

The question is what strides Tagovailoa will make this offseason.  Saban leans to playing the experienced guy, but he will play the best player and the one who gives the team the best chance at winning.  Calls for him to start over Hurts or to be inserted in place of Hurts when the game is on the line this season are misguided.  

Next year, though?  I don't know, and I'm not going to definitively say Hurts will remain the starter.  Tagovailoa absolutely could show enough to overtake Hurts during the offseason.  (That wouldn't prove the Tuapologists right this season.)

I'll, of course, lean towards the starter with the experience until he shows me reason not to.  I think the team can definitely win a championship with Hurts.  Hell, they were seconds away from doing it when he was a true freshman.  Hurts isn't the sole reason the team has gone 24-2 with him as a starter, but he is a big factor in that.  He also doesn't shoulder the entire blame for those two losses.

Yep, the true freshman has the single game high for tackles in just the one start.  And his 10 solo tackles are also the most by any Bama player this season in a single game.

Moses also made plays behind the line of scrimmage, coming up with four tackles for loss, which, again, is the most any Alabama player has in a single game this year.  That total alone would be the 7th most all season, but he made 1.5 last week against Mississippi State.  His 5.5 TFL on the year ties him for 4th on the team with Minkah Fitzpatrick and Shaun Dion Hamilton.

**Trade Tuesdays** - Post your ESO trades here!  
**Workshop Wednesday** - Give crafting tips, offer services, help your fellow crafters!  
**Theorycraft Thursday** - Discuss builds, skills, strategies and more!  
**Guild Fair Friday** - Advertise your guild, find a guild!  

As you can see, we do not have weekly threads scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.

To this end, we are looking for suggestions for weekly threads on Saturday/Sunday. If you have a great idea, feel free to PM it to /r/elderscrollsonline including why you think it'd be a useful weekly thread.  

**DAILY THREADS:**  

Now we've gotten a lot of requests for daily threads to return, and we've had a good discussion and will be bringing back the Daily Set Discussion threads. These will be posted by the new Dwemer Automaton bot and will give you a chance to discuss a different set every day.  

Once the Daily Set Discussions have run their course and we have ran out of sets, we will be moving to Daily Skill Discussion. If you have any suggestions for what to do after we run out of sets and skills, once again please feel free to PM them to /r/elderscrollsonline.  

We hope you enjoy the current schedule of weekly and daily threads, and if you have any issues, please let us know either by commenting here or PMing /r/elderscrollsonline and letting the mod team know.

Today we've been surprised with the fact that the Morrowind PTS will be making an appearance on the Public Test Server! Before we get into what that means you can test, it's important to note a few things.

**NDA:**  

The entirety of the closed Morrowind beta is under NDA, this means you cannot post screenshots or videos of Morrowind-related content on the PTS anywhere and that includes this subreddit. During PTS play your screen will be watermarked with your e-mail and so it is clear who the screenshot came from. Posting anything like this will result in the post being immediately removed, a subreddit ban and possible exclusion from the Morrowind PTS.  

Please abide by the NDA, if you post anything from the Morrowind Closed Beta it will be removed. We welcome discussion on Update 14 here however. If you are unsure, please post in the official forums.

Further to this, we have added a new report option; ""Violation of NDA"". If you see anything that violates the testing NDA please report it as soon as possible so we can remove it.

**What is being tested?**  

On the PTS this time around is Update 14, the base-game update to ESO including bug fixes and class balance changes among other things. This is testable by everyone with the PTS downloaded and is under NDA.  

Also on the PTS is Morrowind, the first Chapter for The Elder Scrolls Online including the new Warden class, Battlegrounds, a new Trial and much more. This is a closed beta and only able to be tested by invited players. The first wave of invites will be sent out via e-mail when the PTS goes up however if you did not get an invite do not worry! New invites are being [sent out each week](https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/335592/) so keep an eye on your inbox!

**Where can I give feedback?**  

If you are testing the Update 14 base game update, you can give your feedback in the [Public Test Server](https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/pts) forums.
If you are part of the Morrowind Closed Beta, you can give your feedback in the private [Morrowind Closed Beta](https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/morrowind-closed-beta) forums.  

With that out of the way, we hope you have a great testing period and if you were lucky enough to receive an invite to the Morrowind Closed Beta that you test thoroughly and give plenty of feedback.

**UPDATE 21st April 2017**: Zenimax have partially lifted the NDA on the PTS.

> As of right now, we are partially lifting the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) specifically for the balance changes made to the four existing classes. This means you’ll be allowed to talk publicly outside of this forum area about the changes for the four existing classes and how they affect your character on the PTS in different scenarios, including how your characters perform in the new Battlegrounds and Trial.  
>  
> Please note that the NDA still applies to any content in the Morrowind Chapter such as Vvardenfell, the Warden class, Battlegrounds, and Halls of Fabrication. For the latter two, it’s fine to discuss how your characters perform in them for the sake of class performance and balance discussions, but please refrain from divulging details about the Battlegrounds and Trial. If you have any questions about this, please don’t hesitate to ask.

This means we can and will allow U14 discussion on this subreddit however the NDA still applies to all Morrowind content.

**UPDATE 28th May 2017**: Zenimax have given some content creators permission to post videos from the Morrowind PTS, including videos of the Warden class and a few others. If you see a video and are unsure feel free to report it however.",[News] Update 14 PTS and Morrowind Closed Beta: The NDA and You!

Today begins the day of ESO's third anniversary. Since releasing in 2014 the game has seen many changes and experienced a surge in players, we've visited lands little visited before ESO's time such as the Gold Coast and Wrothgar, even joined the Dark Brotherhood in their Black Sacrament.

To celebrate, Chef Donolon will be visiting a city near you and offering you a wonderful cake for a small exchange of ingredients. This cake will give you double XP for the duration of this event and has infinite uses, so be sure to use it all the time when out adventuring!

Furthermore, when completing a daily quest, you will receive an ""Anniversary Gift Box"" that contains crafting materials and also a small gift in the form of a rare item or motif. You can complete up to 50 dailies per day per character so be sure to take advantage to the free items whilst you can. If you are unsure about what dailies are or how to obtain them, I recommend /u/dominoid73's *excellent* guide [The Dailies of ESO](http://tamrielfoundry.com/2017/04/the-dailies-of-eso/).

Everyone can participate and everyone loves cake, grab your cake today at [14:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ESO%27s+Third+Anniversary+Event+Begins&iso=20170404T10&p1=419) (please click for the start time in your area) and the event ends at [14:00 UTC on the 18th of April 2017](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ESO%27s+Third+Anniversary+Event+Ends&iso=20170418T10&p1=419) (please click for the end time in your area).

Performers roam the streets mocking the rich and famous, towns celebrate with a variety of traditional festive pranks, and guests are encouraged to participate in silly games to win joke prizes.

The Jester's Festival kicks off today at 10am EDT (3pm BST, 4pm CEST). If you'd like to show off your zany side, you can travel to the pavilions that have been set up just outside the cities of Ebonheart, Vulkhel Guard, and Daggerfall. 

At each location, you will find one of three Jesters in extremely convincing dress up as either King Jorunn, Queen Ayrenn, or King Emeric. Talk to one of the Jesters and complete the intro quest “The Jester's Festival"" to get the Pie of Misrule, a special memento that grants a two-hour 100% XP buff during the Jester's Festival period! After the Jester's Festival ends, you'll keep the pie but the buff will be gone. Once you've completed the intro quest, you can then talk to each Jester to receive a uniquely mischievous task once per day for the duration of the festival.

Of course, we do not expect you to take on these epic labors from the goofiness of your own heart. When you complete a daily task for one of the Jesters, you will receive a Jester's Festival Box that can provide some seriously silly rewards, including:

* A new hat – The Crown of Misrule
* A host of fun new consumables
* Unique Jester's Festival memento:
* Cherry Blossom Branch
* New Jester's Festival Housing items:
* Jester's Large and Small Trees
* Jester's Standard
There are also hosts of new Achievements you can earn throughout the duration of the event, including one that grants the completely legitimate title of Royal Jester!

Finally, throughout the duration of the event, the Crown Store will feature some Jester's Festival-themed items, including:

It's that time of year, I am growing things in the back garden and we have some lovely birds that visit et cetera however, as it usual, the magpies and pigeons are a nightmare on crops and the lovely wildlife that try to visit the garden.

The problem is, all of my FAC stuff is clearly too powerful for these and so I am on the look out for a PCP air rifle to take birds in the back garden via general licence.

Does anyone have any suggestions or personal experiences with their own PCP rifles that work well for this purpose? Happy with a .22 or .177 but really would prefer PCP.

Budget is £250-£650 or so. Could take it to the range every now and again too!

I did this based on benchmarks I saw of the cards remaining cool-ish and still managing decent FPS in games like The Witcher 3 and such having reference coolers.

Anyway, today I decided to return these cards because the thermals are **awful**. I was expecting maybe a bit of throttling if I OC'd the cards like crazy and didn't run maximum fan, but what I actually got was unbelievable.

My room is currently 20C, not hot but not cold and my 1080s in SLI are currently idling at [63C and 53C at totally stock clocks](http://puu.sh/ph6U9/8f4e24b782.png) with basically no utilisation.

Trying The Witcher 3 at 4K with max settings had the cards reaching 92C (!) despite me only getting 40 FPS because the cards were throttling back to as low as **60% utilisation** despite the fans being at 100% speed constantly and sounding like jet engines at a whopping **59 decibels** one metre from the PC and may I remind you this is all **with totally stock clocks**, it is [absolutely crazy](http://i.imgur.com/SqnOx5w.png).

I cannot believe NVIDIA have released this cards as-is because they may be the most powerful cards on the planet and possibly fantastic if you throw them under water but these cards with these coolers are just diabolical and not worth any amount of money, let alone what they are asking for them. Cards returned, will wait for the MSI Twin Frozrs I think!

**TL;DR:** The GTX 1080 FEs run far too hot to actually use their power.

P.S.: Before anyone mentions it, I knew the cards throttled a bit when I purchased them, I just didn't know they throttled to this extent. The reference coolers have always been bad in comparison to AIB coolers, but these are just in another league of bad. I've learned my lesson, won't buy reference ever again.","So, about those 1080s..."

I upgraded from dual 780s to dual 1080s in SLI and it's quite the difference!

There are pics of the cards in the setup [just here](http://i.imgur.com/aC42YjX.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/eyGENwp.jpg).

Now, my biggest complaint is that when I opened NVIDIA Control Panel, I was greeted with a message saying [a higher performance SLI bridge can improve your experience](http://puu.sh/pf9NR/9c444059f2.png) which is all well and good but NVIDIA aren't selling the new high-bandwidth bridge anywhere as far as I can see.

Posting this here as a reminder to myself and hopefully for those that may need some motivation at times.

On December 23rd 2015 I weighed 171lbs, down from 216 in August 2015 (45lbs down). I then stopped calorie counting for Christmas and my New Year trip to visit friends overseas. I didn't overeat massively and I followed my new lifestyle ""mostly"" but when you have such ridiculous amounts of treats and eating out every night overseas it is very hard.

Long story short I came back on January 7th and weighed myself and I was at 186lbs (A 15 pound gain!). Obviously I was expecting a bit but not *that* much. It was discouraging and I could have easily turned that into a ""bad January, start in February"" thing but I knew I had to put my foot down to avoid going backwards.

I went back to my new good ways and today (07/02/2016) I weighed myself and I am down to 169lbs, two pounds lower than before!

To me it feels like a lot of weight loss is made up of small decisions made often, having cucumber instead of chocolate or taking the pan-crust pizza instead of Chicago-style but just sometimes you get the **big** decisions that make or break your loss and it feels like I passed one and got it right this time.

Hope this helps somebody and I **had** to tell someone, this is my proudest achievement in weight loss so far. It really feels like I stood up and stopped an avalanche about to happen!",[SV] How good it feels to get back on track!

There's a lot of chatting on the forum recently about how Veteran Maelstrom Arena is nigh-on impossible unless you're some kind of superhuman entity and *especially* so on Console due to the restricted UI and controller usage.

Well, I figured I'd give it a go and found it to actually be not all that much harder, just slower. It's plenty doable.

> 23/M SW: 216lbs. CW: 174lbs. GW: 160lbs.

I've had a bit of up and down weight in my life. I was quite a small child, big-""ish"" adolescent and I got fitter around the age of 16 as I started racing cars and karts. At the age of 17 I had a motorcycle accident that broke both my thighs, my neck and my back. After many years of rehab and still being disabled my weight went up and up to a max of ~216lbs. I hated this.

Recently I have stopped essentially all of my medication which has given me far more energy and drive to get back to the weight I was when I was younger and the fitness level I had then. I started after I got a kick in the bum which made me realise how far I'd gone.

My life has been exactly the same except I eat less and I move more. If I eat it or drink it then it gets logged, simple as that. Due to disability I can't run but I can cycle on spin machines etc so that's what I did! I got a Fitbit Charge HR (These things are AMAZING!) and went for it!

I started at 1,900 cal/day (about a 400 deficit) and then dropped to 1,700 cal/day and now to my present amount of 1,500 cal/day. I take multivitamins each day and (almost) always hit my macros. Currently I am even lower (1,400 cal/day) due to ""saving"" calories for Christmas!

The only vice I have is that I eat 500 calories above my usual limit on a Sunday. This helps keep me happy and that extra 500 calories adds up, sure, but knowing I can eat an extra scoop of ice cream or something feels pretty darn good and ultimately it's still under my maintenance calories (about 2,600 according to my Fitbit).

So, sorry for the post, it is picture time! I apologise for the messy hair, these are all taken when I wake up! Also if you have any questions just post below, will try to answer. :).

Finally [here is my MFP graph](http://i.imgur.com/XQHMlDe.png).

Just spotted [this lovely article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34248179) on the BBC News website. It seems HMIC are rallying the line of ""It's easier to get a gun than it is to get a bus licence"". What do you guys think?

**Full text for those that can't visit the page:**

More people are likely to die in shootings unless firearms rules are overhauled, a watchdog has warned.

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies said it was easier to own a gun than become a bus driver because of flaws in medical checks.
The HMIC said the licensing system for England and Wales has fundamental gaps and previous recommendations for reforms had not been acted on.

Only four of 11 forces it inspected were effectively monitoring licences.
As of March last year, 734,336 people were entitled to possess and use shotguns or rifles under the legal system for licensing and certificating firearms in England and Wales. In total, these people owned more than 1.8m guns.

Gun crime is very low in the UK - and murders and manslaughters involving shootings are relatively rare. There were 29 in the year to March 2014 - and three of those involved a legally held firearm.

Stephen Otter, the inspector behind the report, said that while evidence showed that licensed gun holders were very unlikely to be involved in crime, cases where individuals did shoot themselves or others, such as in domestic disputes, often had medical conditions at their root.

""It is highly likely that if these processes are not tightened up satisfactorily, there will be another tragedy, particularly if you look at mental health and growing issues around dementia,"" he said.

""Too often, forces are not following the Home Office guidance that is in place, sometimes inexcusably compromising public safety. Lessons from past tragedies have not always been learnt and this fails the victims of those events, including their families, unacceptably.""


**Gun ownership in England and Wales**

* 151, 413 firearms certificates on issue as of March 2014 - typically meaning sports rifles
* 582,923 shotgun certificates on issue
* 1,837,243 shotguns and firearms licensed
* 72% increase in licensed firearms between 1998 and 2014
* 260 certificates revoked as a result of a review and 949 applications refused

Each police force oversees licensing in its area - but the HMIC said the national guidelines were being inconsistently and inadequately applied and lessons from past tragedies had not always been learnt.
Applicants must disclose any relevant medical condition and give the police permission to speak to their GP.

However, doctors don't have to respond to the police request - and in practice many licences are issued without policing having completed full medical checks or speaking to referees.

The HMIC said that these gaps in the rules meant someone applying to become a bus driver faced more rigorous medical checks than someone who wanted a gun.

Didn't see a post on this so figured I'd bring it to the attention of the subreddit.

If you [click here](http://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/176211/experience-point-boosters/p1) you can see a post by Jessica that they are adding both the Crown and Crafted XP potions to the game next week.

There are some interesting things to note, first of all:

>Both Psijic Ambrosia and the Crown Experience Scroll can be used at any level or Veteran Rank. **Their boosts apply towards advancing your level, advancing your Veteran Rank, and for advancing your Champion Points.**

We finally have confirmation that both Crown and Crafted **will** affect VR and CP gain contrary to what myself and /u/dominoid73 have found in our datamining efforts which said the Crown booster would not affect VR/CP gain.

> The Crown Experience Scroll, as the name implies, comes from the Crown Store and can be **purchased for 1,000 crowns for a pack of 5.**

As you can see the Crown XP Pots will be 200 Crowns each and last 2 hours per drink which means in the UK we will be paying around £1 ($1.6) per XP potion. I'll leave it up to you guys and girls to decide whether or not that is reasonable.

Lastly I'd like to point out that these are **only being added to the PC and Mac clients** next week. As far as I know there is no word on Console release so Console players will have to wait and see!

Sorry if there is already a thread on these, I couldn't find anything on it!

**EDIT:** I'd like to point out that with 2x Mara (20%), ESO+ (10%), Booster (50%) and PvP Buffs (32%) you are looking at an extra 112% XP. That's a huge amount and will make levelling a *lot* quicker.",[PC/MAC] XP POTIONS - Confirmed for patch Monday 15/06/2015.

Just a quick question as I am about to report this as a bug and message CS about it, loading screens.

When I play, every second or third loading screen I get when travelling, *especially* with Wayshrines, is an infinite loading screen. It will sit there and ""load"" for hours and nothing happens and the only solution is to hard shutdown ESO and restart the game.

I also get infinite loading screens at least once or twice a day on character selection, just as infuriating.

This is not zone-specific, it happens intra-and-extra-zone when using wayshrines and seems to be entirely random but it means that if I play ESO for ~8 hours I have to shut down and restart ESO every ~30 minutes or so unless I don't zone anywhere. Very, very frustrating.

When loading screens work, they are great! Very fast, but most of the time for me, they don't work, and I just wanted to see if anyone else also has this issue.

If so, I am currently stuck. I have completed the Almanac and yet the quest objective is still ""Experience the Daggerfall Covenant"" and Cadwell refuses to acknowledge that I've actually done what he has asked, due to this, I am unable to continue to the AD areas and so start working on Cadwell's Gold.

Specs:  

CPU: Intel i7-4930k Hex-Core 3.4GHz.  
CPU Cooler: NZXT Kraken X60.  
RAM: 16GB G.Skill 1600MHz DDR3.  
Mobo: ASRock X79 Extreme4.  
GPU: 2x MSI GeForce GTX 780 3GB Twin Frozr.  
HDD: 4TB Western Digital Green.  
HDD2: 250GB Samsung.  
HDD3: 250GB Samsung.  
SSD: 1TB Samsung 840 EVO.  
SSD2: 60GB Kingston V300.

Fans: 7x Corsair Air Series AF140 (Four on CPU Cooler).  
Keyboard: Corsair Vengeance K70 with Cherry MX Browns.  
Mouse: Roccat Kone.  
Monitor: Iiyama 27"" 1080p 144Hz.  

Wanted to go all out, this PC has the PSU power and space for a third GTX 780 which will be going in the PC in the next few months.

I was *meant* to have 32GB of RAM, but I was damn tired when I ordered all the parts and accidentally ordered 8x4GB instead of 4x8GB, however, returning would have been a huge pain in the ass so my girlfriend ended up getting a RAM upgrade!

Also, I went with 780s instead of 780 Tis simply because the price difference doesn't justify the performance difference at all and I will be putting a third GTX 780 in very soon and that's far better in terms of performance than two GTX 780 Tis *and* cheaper to boot!

The Kingston SSD is a dedicated OS SSD, I prefer this setup as it means I can just pull it out easily and it makes reformatting easier and trouble-free.

It's time, I've given my old PC to my GF for her to game on and that means I need to build a nice new one for myself! I love this part.

Anyway, my question is as thus: Compared to a GTX 780, is a GTX 780 Ti really worth the extra £200 or whatever it is in the UK? Bear in mind, I will be going dual-SLi with whatever I build, with the space and mobo to put in a third in the future should I ever wish to do so.

From benchmarks I see, the performance is so close that, in the real world, when it comes to gaming there is very little difference. Maybe 5-10% increase in FPS? I just think that gap will be even narrower when SLi'd in a high-end build and, yes, my build is expensive, but I don't fancy throwing money at something that won't add anything, even if it is only a small fraction of the total build cost, I'd rather put the money elsewhere.

Also, if you guys do have any input on my build, that'd be amazing. It's being ordered very soon and I want it perfect.

If you [click here](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/JJtTZL) then you will see my new build. Before you guys ask, reasons.

* 32GB of RAM: Fantastic for the small amounts of video editing and recording I do, plus, I could RAMDisk if I wanted, but RAM is so cheap anyway, why not?

* The 128GB SSD: It's a dedicated OS drive, it means I can reformat without losing anything on the 8TB of storage drives or the 1TB SSD.

So, that's pretty much it! I just want to know whether you guys think I should stick to 2x GTX 780 Ti with the view to go to 3x GTX 780 Ti some time in the future *or* whether people are of the opinion that, I should drop to 2x GTX 780 with the view of going to 3x GTX 780 in the future. If you guys could give me some input, that'd be fantastic.

**EDIT:** Cases! I'm not too sure on the case in that build, but I'm pretty picky with cases and the less work I have to do to it to make it just right for me the better. If anyone has a case they think would work well with this build, please post it! Thank you!","So, tell me, is a GTX 780 Ti really worth it?"

The reason I ask is that I have a physical issue with my left index finger which makes changing the button impossible, and as I need to aim I am then stumped.

This test is difficult enough for an able person but I am struggling like crazy, I don't want to 'cheat' the test but I feel that due to my unique issue makes it nigh-on impossible to do.

Plus, I am finding the parkour aspect in this test almost like RNG. I do exactly the same thing each time and sometimes I will wall run, sometimes I will fall, sometimes I won't backflip or whatever else happens. Even with my input being the same every time, and get this, I am very, very good at parkour in this game, it feels like RNG is deciding whether or not I can wall run.

Ill be honest, I've found it incredibly frustrating.

Game 1 (offline mode) - Just ran around getting used to the controls and basic mechanics of looting and the UI ect. Killed a scav with my pistol and took his shotgun. Found a bunch of bodies and looted what I could carry. But eventually (40 mins-ish) I got tired of not being able to figure out where the exit was and just alt-f4'd as I needed to go do things irl. Not bothered by this though as I know you dont keep anything you loot in offline anyway.

Game 2 - Spawn into my first online game with starting gear and some guy is sat with a shotgun 3 feet from where I spawned and shoots me the second I load in. Raid time 5 seconds. Umm ok.... I didnt want that gear anyway... /s

Game 3 (scav) - Yay nobody at spawn this time! After a few mins see what I assume is an AI crouching looking the other way. No body Armour or helmet just some green tactical jacket and a pistol. I shoot him 8-10 times with my starting pistol and he just stands up turns 180 and two shots me. WTF

Game 4 - Sneak about for a few mins. Again I see a dude just crouched looking off into space with his back to me. Again I shoot him a bunch with the same kind of starting pistol and again he just spins around and 1 shots me with a shotgun. 

Game 5 - Never see or hear anyone for 20 mins of sneaking around with just a knife. Find a grenade. See a player walking on some kind of patrol around a gas station. Kill him with the nade. Loot his shotgun and vest. Manage to find an extraction point at some tower on a dock and get out. 

Game 6 (scav again after the 1hr cooldown) - Spawn in and again some guy just shoots me a second after I load in. Same map as before (factory)

I would consider myself a very high skill FPS player its basically the only genre I play (Global CSGO for nearly two years with 10k hours, 23% solo win rate in PUBG solo's and Ive ranked in the top 5000 players on EU in the past, hundreds of ours in Arma 2-3 and Dayz Standalone), Played every battlefield, ect ect. I've even had repetitive strain damage from the amount of FPS Ive played over the years. You get the point.

I KNOW im not missing shots in this game. The players I'm shooting, which I assume are AI, have been crouched 10 feet away with their backs turned both times. It just feels like I'm getting fucked over by the game/AI system/netcode. 

And in 1/3 of my games I've been killed by what I assume is someone spawn camping. 

Is the state of this beta so bad that this is common right now or have I just had terrible luck? My friends hyped the game up to me as they know this is my kind of jam and they all play it constantly. 
I don't know if I should just go back to CSGO and PUBG and check back in in a couple months or give this game more time. Can someone please let me know if my experience is typical or not? Because, right now, I'm finding it unplayable.

I've never owned a suit up until this point. As a student I've not had the money to spare or the need to wear one. Its something I've wanted for a while and now I'm really excited to finally own one. Any feedback or advice would be much appreciated! Please be honest, even if it's harsh.

Also, i have a few questions (sorry if they seem basic to some of you);

•What are the rules with buttons left open on both the jacket and waistcoat? Im fairly sure the bottom ones should be open on the waistcoat but I'm not sure if i should on the jacket as I'm pretty tall (6""2).

•Do i need a tie clip thing (not sure if it has a name)  and cufflinks? 

•Do i need a handkerchief in the top pocket of the jacket and if so what recommendations would you guys have regarding colour and fold?

•The tie... Yes or No?

We get Kinder Eggs with the little toys inside and dish them out to the players! The ones i have in my local shop have Animal Planet themed toys so far. The figurines are pretty nice and can be used on our DnD mat. The animal planet ones actually fit pretty well into the DnD world as well.

We could say that a character would go out to forage, hunt, etc when they are resting in the wild. The whole party or one person can go.

The chocolate would heal your character for a number of hit die, maybe 1-2.

Thing is, whatever pops out of there will be a random monster encounter. Some are wolves, foxes, tigers and bears. I think they have another batch with more African animals like Rhino and Lions. There are many other collections which can be interesting to use, there's also a My Little Pony batch which I will not incorporate... (unless the DM is cruel)

The encounter can be an opportunity to gain one more hit die or rations for hunting wild game, a fight with a feral animal, an opportunity to tame a companion, or some kind of NPC encounter

My DM is planning to gift 1 batch to his players during a game, and will charge the price of the Kinder Eggs (about $2) for this ""snack/DLC"" for any more requests - Just a way to have a bit of a treat during a game and a cool little figurine.

Any suggestions on how to tweak this mechanic or thoughts would be appreciated!

One day, he decides to throw paper at me while we were watching a film we were going to be quizzed on. I told him to knock it off, but he kept going. I put up with it... because as he was pelting me with these worthless little pellets, i was working quietly on a massive WMD of a paperball. Big was not enough, i thought of what else i could add to it. Oh i can put smaller pellets in the crevices too! and what's this? chalk and a paperclip! i proceeded to scrape chalk powder all the while being pelted mercilessly. As he saw me stating to ignore the pellets, he proceeded to make them bigger and more obnoxious. They started to really irritate. He heaved a heavy paperball and i saw that as a gross hostile action.

I looked at my creation. Was the world ready? Did I have the right to use this dangerous weapon against my assailant? Would i get detention? These were all great questions that i didn't ask myself before i stood up, turned around and did a baseball pitch straight at his face. What a glorious weapon, it flew straight and true and when it hit its mark the little pellets exploded along with a white plume of chalk. Utter devastation. Now, he wore glasses so he had eye protection. But that only added to the surface area of chalk covering his face afterwards. He was pretty stunned.

The teacher yelled at me, but i caught a smile on her face when she looked at Jim and no detention, just a stern talking. I passed the quiz too.

I am the king of excuses and a master of procrastination. I spent years fat, depressed, and miserable rather than tackling my problem. I worried about how many times I had tried to lose weight, and gained it back, about how long it would take to lose the weight, and about how bad the excess skin would look if I ever lost it, so I resolved to doing nothing.

And then I had my heart broken, again, because of my weight. It had  happened so many times times before, I thought I would be de-sensitized to it, but I guess it was cumulative, and this time I decided enough was enough. I joined [r/loseit](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit), [keto](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto), [ketogains](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains), and [fittit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/) and followed your posts, read your stories, looked at your pictures, and decided I was going to try again.

Except this time was easier. You guys kept me motivated, inspired, and educated, and I can't thank you enough. Now I owe you, and I want to encourage every person whose still sitting on the fence, wishing things could be different, to just start. Its really not as hard as you think. Don't let the time it will take deter you. Every week in the journey will feel better than the week before. You will look better and feel better and that will serve as strong motivation to continue.

And is it worth it. Fuck yeah, it is. I can not describe how much better life is now. Professionally, socially, and romantically. My depression is gone. I have tons of energy. Everybody treats me better. Girls try to pick me up.  In a weird way, people now seem eager to please me, win my approval, whereas nobody really paid much attention to me before. 

Now looking back, my only regret was how long it took me to take the first step. Every justification I used to delay or avoid starting seems stupid and meaningless now, so I am here to tell you, just fucking start. Tomorrow. No excuses anymore. It is time to take your first step, and I, and the thousands of others in loseit, keto, ketogains, and fitness are here to help you realize your dream.

Thank you all for your help.","If you're still sitting on the fence, its time to get off."

It's been a good minute since I've posted here. I've lurked a good bit but having a roommate is this apartment has diminished my mojo quite a bit. It's damn near impossible to record when someone won't leave. It's even more difficult to do so when they're gone for a couple of weeks.

2. The second audio, [I really need this...](https://soundgasm.net/u/ShyAries/M4F-I-really-need-this),  started as a fantasy phone call between my partner and I, however, I completely threw out the phone part a few minutes in.

It seemed fine when I tested it beforehand but I probably moved the phone when I hit the record button. I'm pretty much giving up recording on my phone and will try using my laptop next time.

I've never had a reason to hate on him really before now. 

I recently found out he published a book last year titled ""The Film Buff's Bucket List: The 50 movies of the 2000's to see before you die"". A list like this I think *could* say more about your tastes, depth of knowledge, and eye for film than almost anything else. It's kindof an ultimate litmus test for a critic to define themselves.

His list: https://letterboxd.com/stjiub/list/chris-stuckmanns-film-buffs-bucket-list/

It took me exactly 3 films to abandon expectations for this list. But it gets continually worse. Seeing Xmen 2, Pirates, and The Last Samurai in succession made start having minor convulsions. 

To quote a poster from the only other reddit thread I could find on this book:  

> 10% of these films star Tom Cruise.  
12% of these films are Superhero movies.  
30% of these films were major blockbusters.  
22% of these films were sequels.  
16% are Best Picture nominees, and 6% are Best Picture winners.
The most represented director is Christopher Nolan, with 3 films. Followed by a three way tie between Brad Bird, Denis Villeneuve, and M. Night Shyamalan.


I'll start with why this book actually makes my soul hurt

- The title. To imply that this is something that film buffs could learn from, or that aspiring film buffs need to see, is an absolute abomination. A good title for this would be ""50 movies that someone who has literally never seen a movie before could start with"". Xmen 2?? Ghost Protocol?? Are you kidding me with this crap? These are not bad movies, but they are also completely irrelevant to the evolution and direction of film outside of the most hollow orientation of finding out what hollywood movies can be profitable.

- There are 4 total foreign movies on this list. Spirited Away, Cache, Oldboy, and When Marnie Was There. The first three are undoubtedly the three most commonly named foreign movies of the last 20 years. Including Cache acts as a 2-birds-one-stone type inclusions as well since it is the *only* arthouse movie on this entire list. I have actually never seen a real-life-educated-critic include that trio as an actual favorite or most recommended foreign film package, because it is so extremely banal it makes me wonder how many non-studio ghibli movies Stuckmann has actually seen. No Jia Zhangke or Hsaio-Hsen or Weersekathural or Yang? No Pedro Almodovar? No Kairostami or Farhadi? No Clair Denis? No Ceylan? Or Audiard or Dardenne or Assayas.... but TWO Studio Ghibli movies. He probably could have been better off just saying ""best American 21st century movies"", but that title admittedly sounds too exclusive a subset that it's almost like admitting you're not an authority on a broad enough range to be worth listening to. Which is the truth. Including these 4 movies in specific is just horrifyingly bad.

- The lack of diversity of genre is actually terrible. Leaving off Baumbach, Malick, Lynch, Anderson, Von Trier, Assayas, Reichardt, Todd Haynes, Mike Leigh, each individually (along with droves of other incredible small-scale indie directors) would be justifiable depending on your biases. Leaving them all off shows a horrendous lack of diversity of interest away from large action, comic, or stylistically-inventive-in-the-most-obtuse-and-obvious-ways. 

- The extreme banality of the picks for directors that *do* deserve movies on this list. I already mentioned Cache, the only arthouse movie on the list - which has *by far* the largest consensus of acclaim of any arthouse movie. Why not pick *Amour* or *The White Ribbon* or *Piano Teacher*? Given he has no other movies even remotely close to it in terms of accessibility or style, it almost feels like an obligatory pick. Of all the Cohen Brothers you pick No Country? Of all the Spielbergs you pick minority report? Of all the Finchers you pick Zodiac? Of all the Soderberghs you pick Oceans 11? It almost feels like he's **trying** to be as uninteresting as possible. 

- Donnie Darko. Is this a joke? This person talks about movies in a professional capacity?


I don't know exactly why looking at this strikes a nerve with me. I think in part it's because he actually has enough of a following that writing a book of essentially movies could be a good opportunity to expand the horizons of his viewers, and that opportunity is completely wasted. Maybe in part also because this list, being his determination of what great movies are, makes me sad that a guy can earn a living with a knowledge of cinema that is dramatically more shallow than I expected. Maybe it's because him thinking his opinions on movies are worth vlogging about, and having people actually buy into his reviews, is bordering on fraudulence. Or maybe this is a satire as critique of vapid fanboyism in modern film; because it would be extremely effective at agitating anyone whose opinions on movies are actually worth publishing. ","Chris Stuckmann has apparently written a book, and it's honestly offensive."

I won't even bother with the corollaries about how star ratings to translate perfectly to on-field play and how we know how good most of these players are so we don't care about recruiting ranking anymore etc. etc. We all know that stuff, just thought it would be interesting to see how big the supposed talent gap was.

Here's the offense stacked up between the two teams:  http://imgur.com/a/ozLAu

Alabama holds a really big advantage in recruiting ranking of offensive players, most notably from the offensive line. Only 4 of FSU's players on offense had a higher recruit rating than the 10th highest Bama player (Jalen Hurts).

The two main characters in all of the following  Michael Haneke movie are named Georges and Anne Laurent.   

Happy End  (father and daughter)  
Amour  (husband and wife)  
Funny Games (husband and wife)(George & Ann for english version)    
Cache (husband and wife)  
The Time of the Wolf  (husband and wife)  
Code Unknown (boyfriend and girlfriend, boyfriend has no last name)  
The Seventh Continent (husband and wife, but last name Schoberg)

Only in The White Ribbon (understandable for a period piece), Benny's video, and The Piano Teacher do the main characters have different names. 

I *think* the intention for this is obvious. Haneke is something like the ultimate modern day moralizer. Be they meditiations on the roots of radicalism, the logical conclusion of violence-immersed media, the ugliness of dying, the ugly history of racism France hides from, or what have you. As such, his characters are almost always written as ideologies or worldviews that he uses to craft his message - a character in his movie does not represent a person, they represent France, or Austria, or Europe, or the Bourgeoisie or the corrupted youth. 

Given his almost self-satirically blunt presentation of his morals (I mean come on, Bennie's video), it stands to reason that he would pick the most obvious stand-in type names for his characters. It seems like these are almost the equivalent of naming your two leads ""John and Jane Doe"" - obvious cues that these are not people he is talking about, but rather they are stand ins for entire classes or nationalities of people.

1. Oklahoma - comfortably the nation's best OL/QB combo. I think there is due trepidation for a new coach, but otherwise no reason this can't be a top 10 team.  (I have them ranked 8th in my preseason poll).

2. Oklahoma State - this offense is going to be a blast, and the defense I don't expect to fall apart. They finished 11th last year (and should have been higher thanks to penalty-gate) and I see no reason for them to be projected any worse than the 10-13 range again this year. (I have them ranked 9th in my preseason poll).    

3. Texas - blah blah blah death taxes and Texas being overhyped, whatever. They just hired the best available-for-hire coach in the country and they've recruited like a top-10 team the last three years. I honestly think they had  somewhere between a 7-6 and 8-5 type team last year that was coached down to a 5-7 record. Combine all the aforementioned factors with the returning experience they have, and I think you're looking at a 9-3 quality team this year (I have them 14th in my preseason rankings). I get people being weary of a team being hyped up and underperforming, it would make sense for someone like, say, Tennessee *who still has the same head coach*, but Texas... you know.... doesn't. 

4. Kansas State - people seem to be very consistently praising Snyder as the wise old sage with one side of their mouth, and then ignoring how good Kansas State could be this year on the other side in a ""bless their hearts, they're really trying!"" kind of condescending way they often do for G5 teams. Typically by giving them a courtesy spot at the bottom of their preseason T25. It's very strange. With a linebacker or two stepping up, this team should be better top-to-bottom next year than they were in 2016, coming off a 9-4 season, and potentially have the best defense in the Big 12 to complement a really sturdy run game that can eat clock and frustrate the living daylights out of tempo teams. (I have them ranked 15th in my preseason rankings)

5. TCU - holy cow have people forgotten quickly about how good Patterson's TCU teams can be (5 top 7 finishes the last nine years) after one down year. It should please TCU fans to know that they have the [most returning experience of any P5 school](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/1/31/14451014/2017-ncaa-football-returning-starters-experience-oregon-tcu-texas) and a coach whose accomplished history should earn him way more respect in any given preseason ranking than what he's getting right now (unranked). I have them 19th in my preseason poll.

There's 5 teams I think you can make a winning argument for being ranked in the preseason (sorry WVU), that's half the conference. And most of the bottom half - WVU, Baylor, TTU - I don't think will be atrocious either. ISU and Kansas are terrible (sorry guys) but every non-SEC conference has a couple of those. 

I think the Big 12 could *easily* end up a better conference this year than the Big 10 (holy drop off), the ACC (have you seen the collective offensive talent graduating from this conference?), or the Pac 12 (IDK). ","The Big 12 was unequivocally the worst P5 conference last year, could it leap back into being in the top-2?"

Why 8? After searching through ranks of programs who had decent or better defensive line play last year, and then looking at who returns for those teams, there were 8 teams I feel comfortable projecting to be truly ""elite"" this year upcoming season. Then I accidentally put 10 in the title which I can't edit, so here we are. 

I will admit that this is kind of a tricky task, as there isn't much really separating an OLB in a 3-4 and a weakside DE in a 4-3, but only the latter counts here; so if you're a team with a great defense due to strong LB play in a 3-4 and you weren't included (directly addressing Wisconsin here) don't be mad at me. 

1a) **Clemson** - http://i.imgur.com/PCD2rG4.png

I wasn't really sure who to pick first between Clemson, FSU and Ohio State, so I'm electing not to choose. Of the top 3 teams, Clemson has the best interior; Wilkins and Lawrence being two future top-half-of-the-1st-rounders playing side by side on the inside. The edge rushing is not quite as proven as the two teams below them, but Ferrell is probably going to be awesome this year, and if Austin Bryant emerges like they expect them to, I think this team has the highest ceiling. 

1b) **Ohio State** -  http://i.imgur.com/JauWux3.png

Returning everyone from what was a borderline elite line in 2016 must be nice. Hubbard, Bosa, Lewis *and* Holmes rotating time on the edge is completely ridiculous. 

1c) **Florida State** - http://i.imgur.com/T4O0Dut.png

FSU, who led the nation in sacks per game last year, also gets in on the tie by virtue of have the most proven returning edge rushers of any school in the nation - with Brian Burns leading all freshman nationally in sacks last year (9.5), and Josh Sweat projected as a 1st round DE in 2018, they have an elite starting tandem. Throw in projected 1st rounder (yes, there are a lot of these between these three teams) Derrick Nnadi at 3T and you've got a pretty nice setup for yourself. 

4) **Alabama** - http://i.imgur.com/ePL7WcG.png

Da'Ron Payne and Da'Shawn Hand could make this unit one of Da'best lines in the country (sorry), but unlike the three teams above them they have significant losses leaving them with an open question at SDE and proven depth. Most likely those questions will be answered by ""5-star recruit who was buried in the depth chart for 2 years will emerge with all-SEC caliber play"", but until it does, they're a half-step behind the 3 teams in front of them. 

5) **Michigan**  - http://i.imgur.com/IeRpvb5.png

All the talk about Alabama's historically great line last year must have frustrated Michigan, whose DL was only a half-step behind in quality. Massive attrition moves them down this low, but Maurice Hurst, Rashan Gary and Chase Winovich are an awesome building block to move forward with. In fact, Athlon's most recent all-Big 10 team had a combined 8 tOSU/Michigan players (four from each school) in their 3 deep, including the entire first team. Trench play will continue to be fantastic between these two schools.

6) **Miami**  - http://i.imgur.com/514YnrQ.png

Behind Ohio State Miami comfortably has the deepest defensive line in the nation, with *five* players returning who recorded at least 9.5tfl in 2016. None of them will likely crack the 2-deep all-ACC team due to teams 1a, 1c and 8 on this list which is ridiculous, but they have a glut of talent all the way through their rotation. 

7) **Washington** - http://i.imgur.com/TfPOEdm.png

Washington doesn't seem to be getting much chatter this offseason for some reason, which is strange because they return a great QB, a great RB, and most importantly an *awesome* interior defensive line. Vita Vea and Greg Gaines are likely 1st team all-Pac12 candidates, with Vea a possible all american. 

8) **NC State**  - http://i.imgur.com/v0XvCWH.png  

In most years this group would be easily top-2 and maybe the best line in the ACC. Bradley Chubb would go on my preseason all-american ballot if I had one, and then two more very good defensive ends come in right behind him alongside a *really* stout interior, and they get that  entire Top-5 back again this year. NC State was almost impossible to run on last year, this year you can remove the ""almost"" from that statement I think. 



**Teams I should mention I thought about but decided not to include**:

Florida (Zuniga, Jefferson), Utah (Mokofisi, Lotulelei) and USC (Porter, Green) have two great players, but a whole bunch of inexperience and question marks beyond those two to make up a complete unit.

LSU and Houston each have a super-duper-elite player but not a lot of talent or proven experience around them. 

Wisconsin was awesome last year overall on defense and returns all of their linemen, but they're largely tasked to soak up blocks and let the linebackers make the plays, so I'll just say congrats on an elite front-7.

You'll notice 7 of the 8 top rushers in the conference graduate, the only returner with more than 800 yards is Mark Walton, who seemed to underwhelm a good bit in conference play (2.9ypc GT, 2.8ypc FSU, 3.4ypc UNC, 3.4ypc VT, 2.5ypc ND, 4.6ypc Duke, 3.1ypc WVU). Jeremy Smith, Jacques Patrick, and Tavien Feaster seem like the heir apparents for Louisville/Clemson/FSU, as they all ran well in limited playtime - but none of them broke 400 yards last year.

1.	Deondre Francois comes back with experience - What do Christian Ponder, Jamarcus Russell & EJ Manuel all have in common? They all made big jumps their 3rd year under Jimbo. Many of his shortfalls were due to being a new starter - reading through the progressions quickly, decision making, pocket presence; these are the types of things QBs get better at with experience. The passing game should take a step forward this year.
2.	Receivers will be better - FSU returns arguably their 3 most explosive receivers, here's a list of all of them sorted by yards per target, with the highlest players leaving: http://i.imgur.com/RAwFzVa.png. There was no question Murray and Tate were the two best receivers on the team by the end of the season, with another year of experience they should be a significant upgrade over Bobo Wilson & Kermit Whitfield. 
 
3.	Run game will still be great - Jacquest Patrick and Cam Akers could either end up being the best RB in the ACC for whoever wins the starting job. If it's a committee, it will likely be the best committee in the ACC as well.  Jacques Patrick has gotten starter carries in 2 games now, USF in 2016 and Syracuse in 2015, both times he played extremely well. Akers obviously could be the top RB in the nation in his class, even if he's not the starter this year he's a world class backup already.
4.	OL has the chance to be the best since 2014 - Minshew, Dickerson, Eberle, Leonard all gave us hope for 2017. Minshew and Leonard both held their own against what was probably the #2 DL in the nation in Michigan. Eberle is underrated by fans and will likely be very solid as a 3rd year center. Dickerson played admirably as a non-EE true freshman, and has the most upside of anyone in the group. The FSU unit is another good tackle away from being complete, and there are two more 4* tackles entering into their 2nd year next year.
5.	Defensive line will be one of the top-5 best in the nation - Gone is Demarcus Walker, but returning are two elite edge rushers in Sweat & Burns, and three extremely talented players back them up in Kaindoh, Pugh and Robinson. Nnadi played the 2nd half of the season like a 1st team all-ACC DT, and Christmas was incredibly stout. They'll be competing with Clemson & Ohio State for best DL in the nation.  
6.	Best LB play since championship season - 2014/2015 saw the bulk of the playing to time to two solid yet unspectacular starters in Reggie Northrup & Terrance Smith. Hoskins & Matthews looked lost early, but by the final 3rd of the season FSU was getting its best LB play since 2013 from these two, and both return along with every LB on the roster behind them. 
7.	Secondary could be one of the best in the nation - preseason AA Derwin James returns, as does 1st-team All-ACC CB Tavarus McFadden. The opposite corner spot should be filled by the #1 CB recruit in the nation for 2016 in Levonta Taylor, and 5* Ermon Lane played exceptionally at SS, which should make way for Trey Marshall to move back to STAR where he's thrived at the role. There are six more 4* defensive backs competing for 2nd team playing time. 
8.	Clemson has to rebuild - Either Clemson or FSU has won the Atlantic every year since 2008. This year Clemson has to replace the greatest QB in school history Deshaun Watson, and 3 of their top-4 receivers in Jordan Leggett, Artavis Scott, and Mike Williams, starting RB Wayne Gallman, and a first team all-ACC center. They also lose all 4 of their 1st team all-ACC defenders. FSU is primed to retake the Atlantic with Clemson entering into what is presumed to be a rebuild year.  
9.	Upset teams are all at home - Miami, NC State, Louisville. Three teams FSU should beat but will all be good enough to be a real threat to upset FSU this year. FSU been upset at home once since 2011, last year against UNC while crippled by injuries, and because of a miracle 55-yard FG as time expired. I would argue UF is the only team in this tier of ""FSU should win but could lose"" played on the road, and FSU has won their 3 road games against UF under Jimbo 21-7, 37-7, 27-2. 
10.	Perfect schedule to get in, even at 11-2 -  FSU plays 5 teams that will likely be ranked in the preseason. Alabama, Florida, Miami, Louisville & Clemson. A win over Alabama would be great, but even a loss wouldn't hurt too much should the Noles go 12-1 and win the ACC. Should the Seminoles drop another game - be it NC St., Miami, or Louisville - wins over Clemson/UF/ACCCG comprising 3 of their last 4 games should still give them a great SOR and momentum to close the season. All it would take then is another conference to have a weaker 2-win champion for the Noles to likely get the nod. The last two years of the playoffs, with 2015 Stanford/2016 Oklahoma, have featured a non-ACC 2-loss conference champion.

I've been pretty invested over the last decade in gobbling up movie knowledge from scratch. It started my freshman year of college, first experiencing the joys of Annie Hall, Butch Cassidy, Taxi Driver, The Graduate and the like; then to my early twenties devouring the full works of Altman, Hitchcock, Lynch etc. while discovering the progressively more obscure (Bela Tarr! Kiarostami!); and now the last couple years circling back to the greats I'd avoided my first go around (Antonioni! Mizoguchi! Welles! Kieslowski!) and lapping up just about everything else that on the surface looks interesting to me. 

I'm 27 now and I think I'm finally at a crossroads. I've seen more movies than almost anyone I know, but I'll still see something like *Jonathan Rosenbaum's alternative to the AFI 100* and feel discouraged at having seen ~15 of the 100 movies he lists. I know I can talk about movies with other movie people, but I don't feel I have the articulacy and vocabulary to talk intelligently or persuasively about them. I want whatever that ""next step"" is to being a true cinephile, but I'm not entirely sure what the next step is. I think I can sum up my self-doubt in 3 questions:

- Is it okay that I still haven't seen *many* American classics, like Bringing up Baby, The Best Years of our Lives, The Philadelphia Story, or the Grapes of Wrath? Do you think all the obvious bases in American movie history need to be covered? I'm sure everyone has a blind spot or two, but how about 20?

- Am I allowed to be completely disinterested in some of the greats, or is part of being a true cinephile taking the time to invest in things you don't think you'll enjoy? I've seen two Ozu films (Tokyo Story, Late Spring) and one Bresson (Balthazar) and have no interest in ever seeing more, except for the nagging urge to be familiar with their filmography. 

- How much deeper knowledge - be it technical filmmaking understanding (e.g. the value in understanding blocking, or why Haneke's cinematography feels so profound?) or philosophical (what is *Wild Strawberries* even trying to say?) or even cultural - do you need to have for the movies you're talking about? Should I have to be able to explain the importance of Bunuel? 

Furthermore, I guess I should just ask outright at what point do you think someone deserves to be called a true cinephile?",At one point do you consider someone a true connoisseur or Cinephile?

**HONORABLE MENTIONS:** Two years ago I head South Carolina and Boise St. as honorable mentions. Both have dropped off the HM list with South Carolina doing so in dramatic fashion. **Oklahoma State** I really wanted to squeeze on because they feel underappreciated as a great program, they're probably 11th if I was ranking past 10. **LSU** dropped from #9 to unranked; they can blame the miserably stacked SEC during the BCS era for why they have only played in one major bowl game this decade, despite 5 top-15 finishes, but they have only themselves to blame for the milquetoast 17-7 record they've amassed the last two years in a weaker SEC. **TCU** also got bumped from 10th to the honorable mentions list, which is still not bad for a program that had to navigate through a jump to major conference play and now a full rebuild for the post-Boykin era. 

**#10 - Michigan State:**  
Record: 68-25 (73.12%)  
Conference Titles: 3  
Top-5 finishes: 2  
Top-10 finishes: 3  
Ranked seasons: 5  
Major bowl Invites: 3  
Major bowl wins: 2  
Losing Seasons: 1    

Michigan State was absolutely cruising through the B1G east with five 11-win seasons in 6 years from 2010-2015. A 7-6  rebuilding blip in 2012 was perfectly excusable, *especially* considering it was follow by three consecutive top-6 finishes in 13-14-15. MSU being the blue-collar overachiever in a division of all-star coaches makes them so darn likable, having their worst season since 1991 is an ugly most-recent impression.

**#9 - Wisconsin**:  
Record: 71-24 (74.74%)  
Conference Titles: 3  
Top-5 finishes: 0  
Top-10 finishes: 3  
Ranked seasons: 6  
Major bowl Invites: 4  
Major bowl wins: 1  
Losing Seasons: 0    

Wisconsin feels like the perfect thematic counterpart of Michigan State, so I'm glad they're ranked hand in hand. Truthfully it was a tough time decided who was #9 and who was #10 on this list. Michigan State has three seasons ranked higher than Wisconsin's best, and felt like a nationally great team at times. On the other hand, Wisconsin's two worst seasons this decade are 9-4/8-6 in 2012/2013. MSU's lows are dramatically lower, and I think the 2016 season alone moved Michigan State from being comfortably ahead to slightly behind their salt-of-the-earth brethren.  

**#8 - Auburn**:  
Record: 60-32 (65.22%) - 1 Championship  
Conference Titles: 2  
Top-5 finishes: 2  
Top-10 finishes: 2  
Ranked seasons: 4  
Major Bowl Invites: 3  
Major Bowl wins: 1  
Losing Seasons: 1  

Auburn  is the hardest team to rank on this list because of their hilarious polarity from season to season. 5 of their 7 seasons this decade they've gone 8-5, 8-5, 8-5, 8-5, 7-6  and 3-9. That gives them easily the worst overall record of any team on this list, and also the most unsuccessful seasons of any team on this list. The other two seasons, the only two season they finished in the top-20, they went 14-0 with a heisman/national title/#1 overall pick, and then lost the national title finishing #2 in the AP poll. I'm sure many people will have a different opinion about how much a national title + mostly mediocrity is worth compared to consistent success. I think their lack of ""good"" seasons still drops them below the next three teams. 

**#7 - Oklahoma:**  
Record: 73-19 (79.35%)  
Conference Titles: 4  
Top-5 finishes: 2  
Top-10 finishes: 4  
Ranked seasons: 6  
Major Bowl Invites: 5  
Major Bowl wins: 3  
Losing Seasons: 0   

Oklahoma is neck-and-neck with the two teams above them, and Bob Stoops has had an awesome late-career resurgence finishing in the top-6 three times the last four years. Four top-6 finishes overall this decade is pretty awesome. They've mostly dominated the Big12, with four conference championships, and  coming very close to winning a 5th. With Mayfield coming back and no conference threats looming on the horizon, I could very well see them moving up these rankings over the next two years.  

**#6 - Oregon**  
Record: 73-20 (78.49%)  
Conference Titles: 3  
Top-5 finishes: 4  
Top-10 finishes: 5  
Ranked seasons: 6  
Major Bowl Invites: 5  
Major Bowl wins: 4  
Losing Seasons: 1  

Oregon started out this decade with an insane run of four top-4 finishes, two national championship appearances, and a 9th place finish as their worst season the first 5 years. They were ranked 4th in these rankings two years ago, and last year still did respectably in a post-Mariotta rebuilding year... Boy did the wheels fall off this year. They actually had the best record in college football from 2010-2014, but are ranked 8th when including the last two years. Going 4-8 was nothing short of a disaster, still their goodwill from those insane first 5 years keeps very comfortably on this list.

Auburn's defense went from being ranked 34th in 2015 to 9th per S&P+ and was widely regarded as the strength of the team.  

**LSU** - LSU pushed Kevin Steele out so that they could grab an elite DC, they went after Wisconsin's Dave Aranda. LSU went from being ranked 27th in defensive S&P+ to 3rd. Not bad at all. 

**Wisconsin** - Wisconsin had Aranda poached from them, so they went with recently fired USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox. Despite going from losing one of the hottest DC's in the nation to picking up a coach that USC cleaned out, they ranked 7th in defensive S&P+ in both 2015 and 2016. 

**USC** - USC fired Wilcox and went after Clancy Pendergast, the 49ers LB coach. The move worked, as they went from 42nd to 20th in S&P+ defensive rating.

But an insanely chaotic past weekend opened a window for FSU to get back into a NY6 bowl. 

The Orange bowl has a guaranteed ACC tie-in, which means that the highest ranked team in the ACC that is not in the playoffs will be in the Orange bowl. Until recently, that clearly meant Louisville, with the potential for UNC or VT to step in. FSU was the 5th highest ranked team in the ACC last week. But both VT and UNC lost to inferior opponents this weekend (GT and Duke), and with neither having impressive games left on their schedule, it's almost assured that as long as FSU wins out (at Syracuse, 17 point favorites and home against Florida as 6 point favorites) the Noles will finish as the 3rd highest ranked ACC team. This means that if both Clemson and Louisville make the playoffs, FSU would be next in line to earn an orange bowl invite. 

Provided FSU wins out, Louisville still needs to make the playoffs. In order for Louisville to make the playoffs two things need to happen.  
First, two conferences need to be out, and a two loss champion should do the trick there. It also looks like Louisville is safely in over the Big12 champion, because West Virginia seems to be quite hated by the committee and a 2-loss Oklahoma would stay behind Louisville; I don't foresee any Big12 team, without an additional win from a conference championship, jumping Louisville in the rankings. That means all Louisville would need is for Washington to lose another game, either @WSU or in the Pac12 championship, and the Pac12 would be eliminated from the playoffs as well.  
Second, they would need to be the highest ranked non-champion. It is extremely likely that Louisville at 11-1 would finished ranked above any 2-loss non-champion. Because Michigan lost to Iowa this past weekend, It is actually impossible for any remaining P5 team to have fewer than 2 losses and not win their conference championship except Alabama, who I'm expecting would make the playoffs either way so that point is moot. One of Ohio State or Michigan must lose to the other, and I think it's realistic to assume the loser of that game will be ranked lower than Louisville.   
 
Boiling all that down: if FSU beats Syracuse and UF, Louisville beats Houston and Kentucky, and Washington State loses another game, FSU will very likely earn a major bowl bid for a 5th consecutive year. 

Sidenote: there are a dozens of other ""chaos"" scenarios here that I didn't elaborate on, but none of them would at all *hurt* louisville's chances of making the playoffs so they aren't discussed. ",FSU could still sneak into a 5th-consecutive major bowl bid

His argument is simply that each individual free throw is makable by an unregenerate person, but God knows that no man ever **will** make every single free throw and therefore we can say functionally that ""all have sinned and fallen short"". 

I told him that he was ascribing to Pelagianism, something that had been resolved by Augustine about 1600 years ago, and that just about every person who has made it through their first year of seminary would disagree with him (admittedly not a persuasive argument).  He challenged me to find a bible verse that referred directly to the idea of man being separated from God by his very nature, independent of his actions, that could *not* be interpreted to also mean as a fruit of his actions which are a result of his nature (an ability to sin).

**Bucks** - They only won 33 games last year; but Giannis hasn't turned 22 yet. The Middleton-Giannis-Parker trio could easily be primed to take a collective step forward and make the Bucks competitive in the East.

**Magic** - Serge Ibaka may be the perfect fit next to Vucevic, and Boyimbo gives them an awesome defender off the bench. The Magic should also look a lot better with a head coach that can coach, and the young group of Hezonja/Fournier/Peyton/Gordon all being a year more developed.  

**Bulls** - this could be an odd fit, but a core of Rondo/Butler/Wade has to be competitive by sheer sum of talent.  

**Knicks** - odd fit #2, but the same argument above applies with Rose/Melo/Porzingis/Noah.

**Heat** - Even with the loss of Wade, a top trio of (hopefully healthy) Bosh, Dragic & Whiteside can contend with/better than just about any of the above 5 teams. 

**Wizards** - inexplicably took a step back next year, but Beal/Wall/Porter are STILL young enough that bringing it back for another year is all they may need to do after being a 2nd round playoff team the prior two years.  


The only two teams I don't see having a decent outside shot are Brooklyn and Philly. I think Philly has a nonzero chance of having their Simmons/Noel/Okafor frontcourt look good several years ahead of schedule, and have Saric/Embiid immediately contributing quality bench minutes so that they sneak into the 8th seed... but that seems like a very long shot, so I'll leave it at 13 teams for now. ",13 of the 15 teams in the East have a legitimate shot to make the playoffs.

There were more than a couple things that I thought were interesting, based on my own personal opinions of how some of these players did this season as well as the general consensus of this sub.

- It probably won't surprise anyone that the four best players in the NBA right now are all in the top 9 (Steph, Kawhi, Durant, Lebron)

- Karl Anthony Towns has an absolutely limitless ceiling; and on the other end of the spectrum, the Porzingis hype was extremely fun but... yikes.

- Sticking with the NYK theme, Carmelo/Porzingis/Rose ranked 54th, 60th, and 65th; that's probably a bit sobering for Knicks fans who expect those three to be the three lead scorers for this team this year.

- Detroits three main scorers being 48th, 58th, and 64th is also a little frightening for their upside in future years

- I think this is a good argument for Magic fans who like the idea of losing Oladipo if only to make room for Fournier as the starting 2

- Giannis also has a really really exciting future. 

- Wiggins has a really really bright future, but he also has some work to do on his efficiency if he's going to take the next step for the Wolves. ",True shooting % - A season in review
1371,53zso,47339,False,False,True,True,mickeyquicknumbers,4620,mickeyquicknumbers,4plg1n,2016-06-24 09:21:18,45.0,71.0,"On one hand I feel like my heart was ripped out because Oladipo was the face of our rebuild and I have been emotionally invested in his development for the last three years, with blind optimism about his long term prospects as a first option. It sucks really sucks to see him gone.

Taking a step back though: the Magic had two serious problems - the first was that a Payton/Dipo backcourt was never going to work, it was just ugly having two guards who could not shoot; the second was that we SERIOUSLY needed a rim defender to pair next to Vuc if we were going to keep Vuc as our long term option at center. This trade solved both those problems simultaneously. We have a lot of flexibility now, pairing Payton with a guard who CAN shoot in Fournier or Hezonja, or both. We can play small ball with the two of them and Gordon at PF/Ibaka at C. I'm guessing we'll probably start with a lineup of Payton-Fournier-Gordon-Ibaka-Vuc though, which is still better, as it provides a good balance of defense, shooting & athleticism. 

From 3-10 ft and 10-16 ft Dipo shot 31.3% and 40.4% last year; Ibaka shot 50.0% and 48.6% respectively, so the Magic really do get a great shooting upgrade AND a defensive upgrade. It also de-clogs the wing positions where Fournier/Hezonja will be given the minutes to keep developing and compliment Payton better. It's going to be nice having exactly one ball handler in our starting lineup. You could argue that if Hezonja busts then the whole ""giving Hezonja room to develop"" point is for naught, but if Hezonja busts then the Magic are looking at serious limitations of their ceiling regardless so it's kindof a moot point.

I can see people critiquing this trade in terms of value in/value out - including the 12th pick with Dipo seems a little steep, but then again the average 12th pick [is really not that great](http://www.mynbadraft.com/nba-draft-picks/12th-overall/120509/). I think picks outside the top-10 are almost universally overalued so I'm not losing sleep over it. Dipo is a guard who can defend at a slightly-above league average level, get to the line at a league at a league average level, and straight up cannot shoot. From the Magics perspective he was a problematic fit, who has not appeared to be  developing in any way that would assuage those problems in future season.

For the Thunder, it's not unrealistic to think that - given the players he's going to be on the floor with - he's going to get more open looks  on the 3pt line, and it would not shock me to see his 3pt% climb to 37-38%, making him basically a Reggie Jackson who is also a plus defender and with a better attitude (He is seriously a great dude). Given that they seem to be invested in Adams, it makes sense to move Ibaka as his value to the team was declining anyways.

The one big issues left, that has nothing to do with the court, is that Ibaka is a free agent after this year. Obviously if he turned into being a one-year rental then this was a terrible idea for the Magic. I think us Magic fans (and ownership) are all banking on the fact that he'll actually fit well in his new, larger role and want to stay. We have gobs of cap room and will be able to pay him as much as anyone else, so finance being equal (and no state taxes) our bid to get him to re-sign should be pretty strong. I think the Magic can make the playoffs next year though with this team; and doing so with a 23 y/o Fournier, 22 y/o Payton, 21 y/o Hezonja, and 21 y/o Gordon would actually leave the team with lots of remaining upside.

Florida State is scheduled to play in a record 36th consecutive bowl game, the Independence Bowl, against Southern Miss on December 27. Their 6-6 record includes a win over Delaware State, an FCS program. For an FCS opponent to be countable towards bowl eligibility, the FCS program must have awarded at least 90% of the FCS scholarship limit. After our own investigation, we have determined and confirmed that Delaware State has not met the 90% threshold set by the NCAA. As a result, Florida State's bowl countable record is 5-6, thus making them ineligible for a bowl game this season. At present, there are three other bowl eligible teams that were not offered a game and it would be unprecedented for a team to go bowling without either eligibility or a waiver while teams who are eligible stay home.

/r/CFB is the first to report on this after an extended investigation into the number of football scholarships at Delaware State. It is important to note that Delaware State is at no fault here, having complied with NCAA rules regarding scholarships and awards. Based on current NCAA rules, Florida State cannot count a win over Delaware State towards bowl eligibility. Given that the Independence Bowl is a week away, there are several options available with most resulting in Florida State playing in this bowl. However, if they do so, they may do so without being bowl eligible.

## Delaware State Data

Delaware State has been in a bit of flux lately, changing both Athletic Director and Football Head Coach [the day after](http://www.delawareonline.com/story/sports/2017/11/19/dsu-changing-athletics-director-football-coach/879043001/) the loss to Florida State. As a result, it's taken a little while to get the data we needed for this, but we did receive validated data from the Delaware State University [Department of Institutional Research, Planning, and Analytics](https://www.desu.edu/about/administration/institutional-research-planning-analytics). They confirmed in writing the following data:

Academic Year|Football Players with Countable Aid|Full-time Grant Equivalent Total
-|-|-
2015-16|78|56.43
2016-17|63|53.20
**Average**|70.5|**54.815**

The difference between the 2nd and 3rd column is the second is the number of students on any kind of scholarship (full or partial, fairly common in FCS), while the second is the sum of the scholarship equivalents, so 2 half scholarships add up to 1. This is the value the NCAA cares about for bowl eligibility. The average of of grants-in-aid per year in football during a rolling two-year period is 54.815. This is 87.008% of the permissible maximum number of 63. As this is less than 90%, **Florida State cannot count the Delaware State game through Exception 18.7.2.1.1**.

## NCAA Rules

Huge thanks to /u/hythloday1 for [surfacing](/r/cfbmeta/comments/7b5ln3/the_evolving_rules_on_57_apr_bowl_teams/)  the updated [NCAA Rules for 2017-18](http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D118.pdf) on this subject. There are a few relevant rules here:

### [18.7.2 - Page 326](https://i.imgur.com/eZiIWVM.png)

### [15.5.6 - Page 212](https://imgur.com/EQGLSVT)

The text of these rules is provided in the comments.

Looking at the rules, from **18.7.2.1** they are not initially considered eligible as they're 5-6 against FBS competition. This is where the FCS Exception that many teams use is applied, which is **18.7.2.1.1**. Florida State's Bowl eligibility hinges entirely on whether Delaware State meets the 90% of 63 permissible maximum number of grants-in-aid per year.

I spoke with the NCAA Educational Line who confirmed a few facts. I'd note that they clarified that the educational line cannot make official NCAA statements. They did unofficially clarify a few questions though:

**Is the permissible maximum number of grants-in-aid per year 63?**

> *Answer: The FCS limit is always 63 (15.5.6.2)*

I asked this because some FCS conferences have different scholarships limits (Ivy League, Pioneer are non-scholarship, as is Georgetown, and NEC is 45), and I wanted to confirm that 63 was the limit regardless. He confirmed it was and linked me to 15.5.6.2 above.

**Does the 90% apply to full-time equivalents or players with countable aid?**

> *Answer: Yes, full-time equivalents (15.5.6.2)*

I asked this because many students are on partial scholarship.

**Does the rolling 2-year period refer to 2015-16 and 2016-17?**

> *Answer: This seems to be the correct interpretation, but could be subject to interpretation between the NCAA and schools.*

This is the question that there may be a little wiggle room on, but this would be the simplest interpretation of the language.

## Florida State Schedule

Date|Opponent|Result|Score|Subdivision
-|-|-|-|-
9/2|[Alabama](#f/alabama)|L|24-7|FBS
9/23|[NC State](#f/ncstate)|L|27-21|FBS
9/30|[Wake Forest](#f/wakeforest)|W|26-19|FBS
10/7|[Miami](#f/miami)|L|24-20|FBS
10/14|[Duke](#f/duke)|W|17-10|FBS
10/21|[Louisville](#f/louisville)|L|31-28|FBS
10/27|[Boston College](#f/bostoncollege)|L|35-3|FBS
11/4|[Syracuse](#f/syracuse)|W|27-24|FBS
11/11|[Clemson](#f/clemson)|L|31-14|FBS
11/18|[Delaware State](#f/delawarestate)|W|77-6|FCS
11/25|[Florida](#f/florida)|W|38-22|FBS
12/2|[ULM](#f/ulm)|W|42-10|FBS

They ended up with a total record of 6-6 after a difficult season whose scheduling was complicated by Hurricane Irma. They [ended up rescheduling](/r/CFB/comments/7be7l5/florida_state_reschedules_ulm_game_to_december_2/) the ULM game which had been initially cancelled following the win over Syracuse when it provided a path to 6 wins.

The most obvious is that Florida State applies for a Waiver under **18.7.2.1.1.1**. We do not believe they have already applied for the waiver, and there was really no reason to for a number of reasons:

* Florida State had preseason CFP hopes and had no expectation of being borderline bowl eligible.
* Given how hard the data was to get, we don't believe anyone had any reason to suspect Delaware State was below the 90% mark.

They could apply for a waiver now, and the issue would be resolved, but this is a formal process they would need to apply to the NCAA Football Issues Committee for. Of note, the waiver for ""unique or catastrophic situation"" can only apply to Delaware State here, not to the scheduling difficulties Florida State has had from Hurricane Irma.

There is some precedent for this. In 2012, Georgia Tech went 6-7 with a loss in the ACCCG, and successfully applied for a waiver and went to the Sun Bowl (and beat USC). They only qualified for the ACCCG because both Miami and North Carolina were postseason ineligible that year, and so the NCAA approved the waiver as it seemed unfair they be punished for playing in the ACCCG. Both Louisiana Tech and Middle Tennessee were eligible that year, but stayed home. Louisiana Tech had an offer from a bowl, but turned it down through a miscommunication in which they expected a better bowl, but Middle Tennessee did not receive an offer from any bowls.

### Ineligible

If Florida State does not apply for the waiver they are considered not bowl eligible. By **18.7.2.1.3(a)** they would be in line before any 5-7 or 5-6 teams by APR *if* there were an insufficient number of bowl eligible teams. However as there were 81 bowl eligible teams and only 78 bowl openings in total, this condition does not apply. 

Western Michigan, Buffalo, and UTSA, the three bowl eligible teams that did not receive a bowl bid this year, all have a rightful claim to the Independence Bowl bid against Southern Miss rather than Florida State in this scenario.

### Approval through Extenuating Circumstances

Given that the bowl is a week away and this is digging very much into the weeds of NCAA bylaws, I think there's a good chance that this gets hand-waved away. If this is the result, Florida State will play in a bowl, but for the first time in 36 years they are not formally bowl eligible. 

I owe a huge thanks to the folks at Delaware State for working to get this data to me through a time of transition in the busiest part of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this story resolves!

This is Nihon's 21's Japanese national championship, and they are second only to Kwansei Gakuin, who has 28. Despite Nihon's rich history, this is their first championship since 1990. 

The Koshien Bowl is the national championship that pits a top team from the West vs. a top team from the East. This used to be just a bowl between the conference champions of the two major conferences, Kanto and Kansai, although since 2009 these two winners face off against other minor conference winners prior to meeting each other. The Koshien Bowl has still only been between Kanto and Kansai teams.

Additionally, the Kansai has won every match since 2007, and only Hosei from the Kanto has won the Koshien Bowl since Nihon won it in 1990. Hosei won it in 1997, 2000, 2005, and 2006. Before this year, Kwansei Gakuin had won 5 of the last 6 championships.

**Final**

Back by popular demand, we are offering team flair prizes for participation in our current drive for bricks and for Toys for Tots! There are 4 main team prizes that you can work together to win.

### Alternate Flair

This is awarded to the team with the most points that doesn't already have alternate flair. [Auburn](#f/auburn) is currently in the lead with 19.

### Battle For Texas

This is a special competition just for teams with alternate flair from Texas due to their continued dominance in these drives, which includes [Texas](#f/texas), [Texas A&M](#f/texasam), [Texas Tech](#f/texastech), and [Houston](#f/houston). [Texas](#f/texas) is five time defending champs and has never lost, and are off to a great start. The winner of this gets a third trophy flair option that they get to keep as long as they defend their title.

### /r/CFB Showdown

This is a similar competition between all other teams with alternate flair, a list which includes [Michigan](#f/michigan), [Alabama](#f/alabama), [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate), [Oregon](#f/oregon), [Ole Miss](#f/olemiss), [Kentucky](#f/kentucky), [Northern Illinois](#f/northernillinois), [Indiana](#f/indiana), [Florida](#f/florida), [Stanford](#f/stanford), [Florida State](#f/floridastate), [UCF](#f/ucf), [California](#f/california), [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia), [Washington](#f/washington), and [Nebraska](#f/nebraska). [Nebraska](#f/nebraska), who just earned their alternate flair 3 weeks ago in the Fall Season of Trivia Tuesday, is out to a truly monumental lead to earn a third flair. This title is currently held jointly by [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) and [Florida State](#f/floridastate), who tied for this last year.

### /r/CFB Logo

This goes to the highest point getter that doesn't already have a team-themed /r/CFB Logo. All P5s and some G5s do, and the current leader is [SJSU](#f/sanjosestate) at 12 points.

**If you're unsure how the points work, please ask in thread or modmail us first.** We're continuously blown away by our user's generosity and we want to make sure each user knows exactly what they receive with their donation. The ultimate purpose is of course building the bricks and donating to charity, and the contests and award flair are just a nice layer on top in the spirit of competition and community.

The point system is designed with two goals in mind:

* To reward teams with many donors
* To reward teams with high donations

All things being equal, we'd rather have 5 users give a $10 donation than 1 user give a $50 donation, because that means more people are involved in the event. Accordingly, each additional point for your team gets harder to accrue. The difference between levels increases by $10 each time, so it's $10 for 1 point, $10+$20=$30 for 2 points, $30+$30=$60 for 3 points, and so on:

Amount|Points|Individual Prize

* Apologies, we went up a little late today! If you tried to access the quiz before 11:25 AM ET you would have seen last week's questions. Your time does not start until you see this week's questions.

Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, and /u/Davidellias. Each week there will be 5 questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability.

There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance.

Prior today, the Toronto Blue Jays were the last Canadian team to win a World Series, NBA Championship, Stanley Cup, or MLS Cup Final. They did so in both 1992 and 1993 with a dominant team, just beating out the Montreal Canadiens' 1993 Stanley Cup win. The poor Expos by all rights had a great shot at the 1994 title that was cut short by strike. 

But wait you say, there is a sixth major professional sporting league in North America, the CFL! Canadian football is a fascinating sport that is well worth a watch that currently only has Canadian teams, just as the NFL only has teams from the US. What many people don't realize is that during the '90s, the CFL had an ultimately unsuccessful expansion attempt into the US, but successfully formed teams in Baltimore, Las Vegas, Sacramento, Shreveport, San Antonio, Birmingham, and Memphis. Of these, the most successful was the Baltimore Stallions, who won the Grey Cup in 1995. [This is a great writeup](http://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/baltimore-stallions-oral-history/). 

Sadly, soon after winning, the Ravens moved to Baltimore, and the Stallions relocated to Montréal to become the Alouettes. In the time since the Blue Jays won their last World Series, the following Canadian teams have been eligible for major titles:

In this last year without a CCG, there is a semi-interesting tiebreaker that actually took a little bit of digging. 

To start, [Appalachian State](#f/appalachianstate) and [Troy](#f/troy) are both 7-1, and are both Sun Belt co-champions, full stop. The conference does award co-championships without tiebreaker, and both teams have fully earned a conference championship.

Beyond that though, the league does have to designate exactly one team for consideration along with the other four G5 champs ([UCF](#f/ucf), [Boise State](#f/boisestate), [Toledo](#f/toledo), [FAU](#f/fau)) for an NY6 Bowl. [UCF](#f/ucf) was so far ahead of the curve as the only undefeated FBS team that their selection was a foregone conclusion, so this was largely a formality, but still necessary.

There's really very little literature on the Sun Belt website on this matter, in large part because it will be irrelevant next year with the CCG. We did find [this set of tiebreakers](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2015/5/8/8561899/tiebreaker-standings-college-conference-rule) rehosted from 2015. It gets tricky because [Appalachian State](#f/appalachianstate) and [Troy](#f/troy) did not play each other, nor did they have any common opponents with a different result. [Appalachian State](#f/appalachianstate)'s only conference loss was to [ULM](#f/ulm), who didn't play [Troy](#f/troy), and [Troy](#f/troy)'s only conference loss was to [South Alabama](#f/southalabama), who didn't play [Appalachian State](#f/appalachianstate). The 2015 tiebreakers would suggest that a coin flip was in order.

We (the @RedditCFB Twitter account) wrote to @SunBelt asking for clarification, and they responded:

> We do have a tiebreaker for this if needed. The team with the best computer ranking in the six computers that formerly made up the BCS would be our representative.

Much better than a coin flip! Those six rankings aren't formulated quite the same as they were during the BCS, but it's something we can calculate.

Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is *not* a measure of how ""good"" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on.

All voters continue to coalesce towards consistency. Of particular note:

* Terry Hutchens is still the most consistent voter.
* Jon Wilner is still the most inconsistent voter on the season, but was only the 5th most inconsistent this week.

Of the 130 FBS teams, 73 teams have hit the qualifying wins mark. See /u/hythloday1's excellent post with a [look at APR eligibility](/r/CFB/comments/7e1qzy/week_13_apr_bubble_tracker_for_teams_hoping_to/). This post is intended as a final look at how the bowl situation could shake out before the last (with the exception of a few Sun Belt games) day of regular season play. Here's the teams as they stand now.

Of the 17 who could still be bowl eligible, 3 pairs of teams play each other: [Indiana](#f/indiana)-[Purdue](#f/purdue), [Middle Tennessee](#f/middletennessee)-[Old Dominion](#f/olddominion), and [Colorado](#f/colorado)-[Utah](#f/utah). This means at least one of these pairs will be bowl eligible, bringing the absolute minimum number up to 76 bowl eligible teams. Here's what the remainder of the season looks like for just the Possibly Bowl Eligible and Possibly APR eligible teams:

[Air Force](#f/airforce)|4-7|997|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR|[Utah State](#f/utahstate)|
[Vanderbilt](#f/vanderbilt)|4-7|997|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR|[Tennessee](#f/tennessee)|

[Maryland](#f/maryland)|4-7|978|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR|[Penn State](#f/pennstate)|
[Tennessee](#f/tennessee)|4-7|978|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR|[Vanderbilt](#f/vanderbilt)|
[Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh)|5-7|973|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR||

[South Alabama](#f/southalabama)|4-7|949|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR||[New Mexico State](#f/newmexicostate)
[UMass](#f/umass)|4-7|922|Not Possible Eligible|Possible APR||

The only teams that should be favored to be bowl eligible outside the 3 above outright are [Temple](#f/temple) and [Florida State](#f/floridastate). In this case, there are exaclty 78 bowl eligible teams, and so all eligible teams go bowling and no ineligible teams go bowling. If more than 78 become eligible then some (likely G5 teams) will stay home. If fewer become eligible, then it gets interesting. Because at most 2 non-bowl eligible teams will go bowling and [Duke](#f/duke) and [Minnesota](#f/minnesota) will go at worst 5-7 and have an APR of 992 and 991, any team that does not hit .500 with an APR of 991 cannot go bowling this year (barring a team declining a bid). The only teams that can qualify through APR this year besides those two are [Air Force](#f/airforce), [Vanderbilt](#f/vanderbilt), and [California](#f/california). The former 2 must win today and hope for an APR spot to stay open. [California](#f/california) can at best tie for 2nd with [Minnesota](#f/minnesota) at 991, and it's unclear how APR tiebreakers proceed.

This means that the list of teams eliminated from bowl contention in any circumstance include: [Pittsburgh](#f/pittsburgh) [Rutgers](#f/rutgers) [Maryland](#f/maryland) [Tennessee](#f/tennessee) [Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh) [Florida](#f/florida) [Syracuse](#f/syracuse) [Eastern Michigan](#f/easternmichigan) [South Alabama](#f/southalabama) [UMass](#f/umass). The remaining list of [Middle Tennessee](#f/middletennessee) [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech) [Indiana](#f/indiana) [Louisiana Tech](#f/louisianatech) [Temple](#f/temple) [Old Dominion](#f/olddominion) [Purdue](#f/purdue) [Colorado](#f/colorado) [Utah](#f/utah) [Tulane](#f/tulane) [Louisiana](#f/louisiana) [UNLV](#f/unlv) [New Mexico State](#f/newmexicostate) [ULM](#f/ulm) [Florida State](#f/floridastate) can all go bowling, but must win any remaining games they have.

I think the most likely scenario is we end up with 79 or 80 bowl eligible teams, and APR considerations are irrelevant.",Final Day Bowl Eligibility Tracker

32 teams remain out of 124 total, down from 33 last week. It's going to be a very interesting bubble.

Combining this together, The Top 8 Seed (First Round bye) projections include: [James Madison](#f/jamesmadison) [North Dakota State](#f/northdakotastate) [Wofford](#f/wofford) [South Dakota State](#f/southdakotastate) [Southern Utah](#f/southernutah) [Kennesaw State](#f/kennesaw) [Jacksonville State](#f/jacksonvillestate) [Central Arkansas](#f/centralarkansas) [Sam Houston State](#f/samhoustonstate)

This is 9 teams though, and there are only 8 spots! The only teams there that I think could possibly be excluded are [Wofford](#f/wofford) and [Kennesaw State](#f/kennesaw) both of which have good records with shaky schedules. Additionally, [Stony Brook](#f/stonybrook), [Weber State](#f/weberstate), and [Western Illinois](#f/westernillinois) could be outside candidates for a top 8 seed.

The 12 teams above will almost assuredly be in the playoff. In particular, [James Madison](#f/jamesmadison), [North Dakota State](#f/northdakotastate), [Wofford](#f/wofford), [Southern Utah](#f/southernutah), [Kennesaw State](#f/kennesaw), [Jacksonville State](#f/jacksonvillestate), [Central Arkansas](#f/centralarkansas) all have autobids for their conference. Additionally, [Central Connecticut](#f/centralconnecticutstate), [Lehigh](#f/lehigh), and [San Diego](#f/sandiego) have autobids. This leaves 9 spots remaining between 17 teams, which include:

These are very roughly in descending order of likelihood. Most of these teams are probably out with a loss this coming week, and several near the top are almost assuredly in. Recapping, my total prediction for tomorrow includes:

Lol.

## [Full Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1On7raahzT82acT5PbyoVG0CBZFmk_Xea_ezWE3g2SyM/edit?usp=sharing)

10 games means that there are 1024 possible results remaining. In several of these games one team will be strongly favored, but you never know! Many scenarios play out wth a simple first and second place team, which would go to the CCG. Others have ties that must be broken using the [Big 12 Tiebreaker Procedures](http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1546006). I've gone through the tiebreaker in each scenario to help figure out how the season will shake out.

You can peruse the full table, but here's the number of scenarios out of 1024 that result in the following top seeds:

1-Seed|Possibilities

SCORING DIFFERENTIAL|SCORING DIFFERENTIAL|5

[Kansas](#f/kansas), [Baylor](#f/baylor), and [Texas Tech](#f/texastech) are mathematically eliminated from even tying for 2nd place. [Kansas State](#f/kansasstate) can tie for 2nd place in a few strange scenarios, but cannot win the tiebreaker to be top 2.

[Texas](#f/texas) can be the top seed in exactly one bizarre scenario where all 10 games break just right for the Longhorns. They have considerably fewer options than [Iowa State](#f/iowastate) to reach the CCG, even though the Cyclones can no longer make the top seed.

[West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) has the second most options to earn the top seed, because they still have to play [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma), but are still in 4th in terms of total routes to make the CCG. [Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate) has a decent number of options to reach the CCG. 

In just under half of the remaining game results, [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) will be the top seed and [TCU](#f/tcu) will be the second. As both teams will be favored in each of their remaining games, this is probably the strong way to bet.

As a final note, there are 5 scenarios involving a 3-way tie between [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma), [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia), and either [Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate) or [TCU](#f/tcu) that would come down to the point differential between them to decide both teams in the CCG. Both of these only occur if [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) beats [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma). These games have included:

Team|[Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma)|[TCU](#f/tcu)|[West Virginia](#f/westvirginia)|Total
-|-|-|-|-
[Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma)|-|+18|-x|18-x
[TCU](#f/tcu)|-18|-|+7|-11
[West Virginia](#f/westvirginia)|+x|-7|-|x-7

[West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) is guaranteed in in this scenario. If they beat [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) by 30 or more, [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) is eliminated and [TCU](#f/tcu) plays [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia). If they beat [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) by 29 or fewer, the CCG is a rematch between [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) and [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) as [TCU](#f/tcu) is eliminated. 

Team|[Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma)|[Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate)|[West Virginia](#f/westvirginia)|Total
-|-|-|-|-
[Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma)|-|+10|-x|10-x
[Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate)|-10|-|+11|+1
[West Virginia](#f/westvirginia)|+x|-11|-|x-11

This one gets really interesting. If [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) beats [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) by 10 points or fewer, [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) is eliminated as they have the lowest differential and the CCG is [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) v. [Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate). If they win by 11 or more, [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) has the lowest differential and the CCG is [Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate) v. [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia). [Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate) is guaranteed in either way.

* Count one (1) point for a win against a Division II team, OR, subtract a point for a loss against a Division II

Since the two teams did not play head-to-head. [North Carolina A&T](#f/northcarolinaat) outscores [Howard](#f/howard) in OOC tiebreaker points by a margin of 11-6. Thus, no teams from the [MEAC](#l/meac)/[SWAC](#l/swac) will be in the FCS Playoff.

* If [Northern Arizona](#f/northernarizona), [Weber State](#f/weberstate), and [Montana](#f/montana) all win, [Montana](#f/montana) and [Southern Utah](#f/southernutah) are tied in conference and so the conference autobid will come down to Sagarin rating between [Weber State](#f/weberstate) and [Northern Arizona](#f/northernarizona). [Weber State](#f/weberstate) had a slim 60.21 to 59.61 lead going into this week, and I thought this scenario would favor [Northern Arizona](#f/northernarizona), but they squeaked by [Montana State](#f/montanastate) this week and [Weber State](#f/weberstate) dismantled a winless [Portland State](#f/portlandstate) team. It's also unclear *which* Sagarin rating is being used here, which matters. I'm going to give this scenario as slightly more likely to be [Weber State](#f/weberstate), but don't take that as canon.

33 teams remain out of 124 total, down from 47 just last week! 

Combining this together, I think for the Top 8 Seeds (First Round bye): 

Losses Possible|Teams

13 teams listed here, I think it's unlikely that anyone outside these 13 will be seeded. I'm a little iffy on giving [Wofford](#f/wofford) a guaranteed seed given that they were seeded 8 by the committee this past week, beat a winless [VMI](#f/vmi) today, and have a bowl-bound [South Carolina](#f/southcarolina) left on their schedule. If they beat the Gamecocks, they're guaranteed a seed if not a top 3 seed. If they lose, they could be just on the outside looking in on the top 8 given how close most of their games have been.

Of these, [Wofford](#f/wofford), [Jacksonville State](#f/jacksonvillestate), and [Central Arkansas](#f/centralarkansas) are guaranteed playoff bids as conference champions. Additionally [Central Connecticut](#f/centralconnecticutstate), and [San Diego](#f/sandiego) also have an auto-bid through a conference championship. This accounts for 15 teams plus the [Patriot](#l/patriot) champion all but guaranteed in, which leaves 8 more at large spots between 16 remaining at large contenders, including:

Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is *not* a measure of how ""good"" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on.

All voters continue to coalesce towards consistency. Of particular note:

* Terry Hutchens is still the most consistent voter.
* Jon Wilner had the second most inconsistent ballot, and is still the most inconsistent on the season by a fair margin.

First, here are my assumptions for each conference that sends a champion to the playoff based on history and strength this year. Each column shows the number of losses a team can have in each conference and: a) get a seed if they win their conference, b) get a seed if they don't win their conference, c) pretty much guarantee a playoff bid, d) possibly get a playoff bid.

The [Ivy](#l/ivy) doesn't participate, and the [MEAC](#l/meac) and [SWAC](#l/swac) champions play in the [Celebration Bowl](#f/celebration-sheetl-row13-col16) instead of the playoff, so only non-champions can get an at large bid. The only [MEAC](#l/meac) and [SWAC](#l/swac) teams who could possibly qualify at this point with under 3 losses are: 

* 8-1 [Grambling](#f/gramblingstate), ineligible regardless of who wins the [SWAC](#l/swac) West because they play in the Thanksgiving Bayou Classic.
* 7-2 [NC Central](#f/nccentral), who will only stay under 3 losses if they win out, and this win the conference, and so will be ineligible for the playoff.
* 9-0 [North Carolina A&T](#f/northcarolinaat). They went to the FCS Playoff last year at 9-2, and this is a legitimate possibility. Their remaining games are [Savannah State](#f/savannahstate) and [NC Central](#f/nccentral). They should win this week easily, and if they and [NC Central](#f/nccentral) wins and then [NC Central](#f/nccentral) wins the rivalry game and thus the conference, [North Carolina A&T](#f/northcarolinaat) will be 10-1 and in all likelihood go to the playoff. This post operates under the assumption that they will not, but if they do there's 1 less bubble spot for the other conferences.

Numbers are shown by how many losses a team can afford and still get each of the following options. Seed is a top 8 seed, Playoff is a guaranteed playoff spot, Bubble is a possible Playoff spot. There may be some super weird tiebreaker situations I'm missing for the conference champs, but I think this is complete.

[San Diego](#f/sandiego) effectively has this sewn up, but there's technically weird tiebreakers they could lose the autobid on here if they drop both of the last 2.

47 teams remain out of 124 total! This week I added in anyone who was possible even in crazy tiebreaker scenarios. [Montana State](#f/montanastate), [Austin Peay](#f/austinpeay), [Holy Cross](#f/holycross), [Campbell](#f/campbell), [Jacksonville](#f/jacksonville), and [Drake](#f/drake) can all only qualify for the playoff through a conference autobid, and all require elaborate tiebreaker scenarios that almost certainly won't happen, so the real number is 41.

Combining this together, I think for the Top 8 Seeds (First Round bye):

I took all our database of games from 1978 to 2016 (did not include 2017 data) to show a heatmap of all sets of scores that have been seen in FBS/D1-A games. 

I also did the same for 1869-2016, although the definition of ""top-division gets a bit more nebulous there. Additionally, [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech) stretches out the x-axis quite considerably with their 222-0 victory.

Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on.

All voters continue to coalesce towards consistency. Of particular note:

* Terry Hutchens is starting to build a lead on Grace Raynor for most consistent overall, and both are averaging under one rank per team from the AP consensus.
* Jon Wilner had the second most inconsistent ballot, and is still the most inconsistent on the season by a fair margin.

First, here are my assumptions for each conference that sends a champion to the playoff based on history and strength this year. Each column shows the number of losses a team can have in each conference and: a) get a seed if they win their conference, b) get a seed if they don't win their conference, c) pretty much guarantee a playoff bid, d) possibly get a playoff bid.

[NEC](#l/nec)|0|0|0|1
[Patriot](#l/patriot)|0|0|0|1
[Pioneer](#l/pioneer)|0|0|0|1

The [Ivy](#l/ivy) doesn't participate, and the [MEAC](#l/meac) and [SWAC](#l/swac) champions play in the [Celebration Bowl](#f/celebration-sheetl-row13-col16) instead of the playoff, so only non-champions can get an at large bid. The only [MEAC](#l/meac) and [SWAC](#l/swac) teams who could possibly qualify at this point with under 3 losses are: 

* 7-1 [Grambling](#f/gramblingstate), ineligible regardless of who wins the [SWAC](#l/swac) West because they play in the Thanksgiving Bayou Classic.
* 6-2 [NC Central](#f/nccentral), who will only stay under 3 losses if they win out, and this win the conference, and so will be ineligible for the playoff.
* 8-0 [North Carolina A&T](#f/northcarolinaat). They went to the FCS Playoff last year at 9-2, and this is a legitimate possibility. Their remaining games are [Norfolk State](#f/norfolkstate), [Savannah State](#f/savannahstate), and [NC Central](#f/nccentral). They should win the first 2 easily, and if they and [NC Central](#f/nccentral) win out and then [NC Central](#f/nccentral) wins the rivalry game and thus the conference, [North Carolina A&T](#f/northcarolinaat) will be 10-1 and in all likelihood go to the playoff. This post operates under the assumption that they will not, but if they do there's 1 less bubble spot for the other conferences.

Numbers are shown by how many losses a team can afford and still get each of the following options. Seed is a top 8 seed, Playoff is a guaranteed playoff spot, Bubble is a possible Playoff spot. There may be some super weird tiebreaker situations I'm missing for the conference champs, but I think this is complete.

## Submission Guidelines

When we tweaked the rules this summer, we moved the submission rules from the Sidebar to /r/vexillology/w/submissionrules. Two in particular are frequently cause for removed posts, so we thought it was worth an announcement to talk about them in a little more detail, and have additionally highlighted them in the sidebar again.

---

### Don't Editorialize Titles

Use a suitable title for your submission, preferably the name of the flag. Please do not unnecessarily editorialize or politicize the title - if you have strong feelings one way or another, you can leave your personal opinion in the comments. If you are submitting a flag that is not officially recognized (e.g. one you designed), please refer to it as ""(A) Flag for X"" rather than ""(The) Flag of X"".

### Provide Context

You must add at least one comment with context, an explanation, your opinion, or a fun fact about your submission to help stimulate productive discussion.

---

Posts that violate either of these will likely be removed. If they generate positive discussion before removal, we will generally keep them up and may sticky a comment. We try to be consistent on these, but we are a volunteer team and can't catch everything. Please help us out by reporting where appropriate!

## Request Link Flair

This has been, well, requested a few times, but there's a new link flair if you want to request a flag design. Our new mod /u/MC_Kloppedie was nice enough to [revamp the link flair flowchart](https://imgur.com/nllWmBr.png) as well. Please add the appropriate link flair to your submissions when you submit!

That's all for now, feel free to ask any questions on the above.",Submission Guidelines and Request Link Flair

All voters are starting to coalesce towards consistency, with Pat Caputo as the biggest outlier this week at 3.36 ranks off per vote.

## Major Notes

* This is just a fun week! It's about /r/CFB itself rather than college football, and will not count towards fall standings.
* [Michigan](#f/michigan) has yet again successfully defended their trivia title, and will keep their third alternate flair!
* [Louisville](#f/louisville) won the TimeOut Championship Tier, and has earned the right to rename it!
* /u/LordMayorOfCologne, /u/TDenverFan, /u/whitedawg are your top 3 Individual scorers!

We want to extend a huge round of thanks to /u/swanky-k and /u/UATitan, who have been on the trivia team for 6 and two seasons respectively! They've both done a ton of work behind the scenes in terms of both writing the questions and rating them so that the weeks aren't too easy or too hard. Their presence on the team will be missed, and hopefully they have the chance to enjoy Trivia from the other side of the test :)

We're also thrilled to announce that /u/Davidellias has joined the team! He's submitted more questions as a user than anyone else, and was officially added to the team shortly after he completed his quiz last week. He'll be joining me, /u/DampFrijoles, and /u/GiovannidelMonaco in running the quiz moving forward. 

Each week there will be 5 questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance.

## [Last Week](/r/CFB/comments/6vbkph/trivia_tuesday/)

0 perfect scores last week in the extra hard and long final (we have yet to see an 11 on a final). The highest score was /u/DrWobstaCwaw with 9 points. Among the individual finalists, the top 3 scorers were /u/LordMayorOfCologne, /u/TDenverFan, and /u/whitedawg, with 8, 8, and 7 points, all in under 4 minutes. /u/xochihuehuetl was first off the podium, missing /u/whitedawg by 19 seconds. 

In other individual honors, /u/THECrew42 and /u/ventolin_3 were the top overall scorers this season with a total of 59 points. /u/chiefcardinal was the fastest among individual finalists on the season, averaging a blistering 0:45.33 each week. /u/_Rooster_ had the highest ratio of weeks played to points scored among users with 12 weeks this season. /u/whitedawg was the highest scoring sole representative of their team, [](#f/williams-sheet3-row18-col10) Williams. We had a total of 2502 users play at least one week this season.

With 6 seasons under our belt now, here are the top 10 users who have consistently performed at a high level:

Username|Finals|Semifinals|Playoffs
-|-:|-:|-:
/u/DevilGhoti|3|5|6
/u/BallSoHerd|2|6|6
/u/LordMayorOfCologne|2|5|6

/u/Honestly_|1|5|6
/u/Aeschylus_|2|4|5
/u/jfader2|1|5|5
/u/royrules22|2|3|6

[Michigan](#f/michigan), once again, won the Premier Tier. 176 proud Wolverines participated in at least one week this season, headlined by /u/BigBoutros, /u/JumpingJays, /u/TMP3407, /u/cjmich11, and /u/JeromesNiece. In particular the 5-some of /u/JumpingJays, /u/wilee8, /u/amedema, /u/IAMA_Fast_Potato, and /u/TMP3407 all scored at least 6 points last week for a combined rank of 183, beating out [Nebraska](#f/nebraska) in 2nd at 257. [Wisconsin](#f/wisconsin) took the bronze, and [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech) came in 4th. The top overall score on the season belongs to [Penn State](#f/pennstate), who missed out on the Final after a Semifinal upset to the Yellow Jackets. 

[Louisville](#f/louisville)'s team led by /u/ACardAttack and /u/chiefcardinal edged out [UCLA](#f/ucla) to win the TimeOut Championship Tier, and so that title is leaving California and heading back east. /u/chiefcardinal and /u/chuckthetruck64 were the two [Louisville](#f/louisville) fans who did best over the course of the season. [South Carolina](#f/southcarolina) came in third, and [Iowa State](#f/iowastate) in 4th. A total of 209 teams played this season, including all but 13 FBS teams.

Thanks again for a fantastic season of /r/CFB Trivia, and we're really looking forward to the Fall! Remember not to stress out about this week as it's just for fun, the Fall season will begin in earnest next week!

*Best of luck to all!*

## [Last Week](/r/CFB/comments/6tun5m/trivia_tuesday/)

3 perfect scores last week, congrats to /u/nedoma56, /u/bigstick22, and /u/LouHoltzSplashZone! The 16 users advancing from last week's Semifinal to this week's Final include: /u/THECrew42, /u/ventolin_3, /u/whitedawg, /u/LordMayorOfCologne, /u/TDenverFan, /u/westcoastwildcat, /u/gonoles287, /u/xochihuehuetl, /u/TheInvisibleEnigma, /u/BigBoutros, /u/BadgerFanSmart, /u/chuckthetruck64, /u/JEMicklos, /u/chiefcardinal, /u/SperryGodBrother, and /u/TheBlueBadger. One of them will be crowned champion of the Summer season! All of them earned at least 3 points in a fairly difficult Semifinal, with the 3-pointers coming in at most 52.17 seconds. /u/ramblingator23 was the first out in 53.27.

[Michigan](#f/michigan) had the best score in the Premier Tier outright last week and won the [Sugar](#l/sugar) at 140 points. [Wisconsin](#f/wisconsin) was close behind as the [Fiesta](#f/fiesta) Champ with 176, who knocked out fellow [Fiesta](#l/fiesta) contender [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) in third place with 179 points. [Nebraska](#f/nebraska) won the [Orange](#f/orange) in 4th place overall, and [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech) won the [Rose](#l/rose) in 7th overall. [Michigan](#f/michigan) is the defending Trivia Tuesday Champion, having won 4/5 seasons, and will earn the right to keep their third flair option with a win. [Wisconsin](#f/wisconsin), [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech), and [Nebraska](#f/nebraska) have all never qualified for alternate flair, and so if they prevail today will keep their alternate flair permanently.

[Louisville](#f/louisville), [Iowa State](#f/iowastate), [UCLA](#f/ucla), and [South Carolina](#f/southcarolina) won their respective Championship Tier Bowls. The winner based on this week will get to rename the Tier for next season!

## [Last Week](/r/CFB/comments/6se13h/trivia_tuesday/)

2 perfect scores last week, congrats to /u/TheInvisibleEnigma and /u/VPI97! /u/illinifan4249 came in 4th overall with 5 points in a blistering 0:53.10 to claim the Cinderella bid to the Semifinal. The top 16 users from the regular season plus the 47 best users who were ranked 47-255 based on last week alone are advancing to the Semifinal. /u/dlawnro was the last in of these 47 with 4 points in 1:07.48, narrowly beating out /u/link3945 for the final spot by 4 seconds. The top 16 individuals out of these 64 based on *this week alone* will advance to the Final next week.

[Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) had the best score in the Premier Tier outright last week, followed by [Penn State](#f/pennstate) and [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech). There were a few upsets, with [Oregon](#f/oregon), [Auburn](#f/auburn), [LSU](#f/lsu), and [USC](#f/usc) missing the Semifinal despite being seeded in the top 16. [USC](#f/usc) narrowly beat rival [Stanford](#f/stanford) in team score last week, but as [Stanford](#f/stanford) came 2nd in their pod they earned a pass to the Semifinal despite the lower score. [Florida State](#f/floridastate), [Texas A&M](#f/texasam), and [Notre Dame](#f/notredame) all punched above their weight class to advance to the Semifinal, and this may be the first time this sentence has ever been said on /r/CFB, but [Alabama](#f/alabama) was a significant underdog and managed to pull off the upset to win the day.

[Louisville](#f/louisville) had the best score in the TimeOut Championship Tier last week, followed by [Purdue](#f/purdue) and [UCF](#f/ucf). Plenty of Chaos as the top 3 seeds, [Fresno State](#f/fresnostate), [Utah](#f/utah), and [Rutgers](#f/rutgers), all went down, which means the Bulldogs will not defend their title. Special mention goes to the very lowest 72-seeded [Georgia State](#l/georgiastate), who defied the odds to advance to the Semifinal! Here's the full brackets for each tier.

[Georgia State](#f/georgiastate)|[South Carolina](#f/southcarolina)|[North Carolina](#f/northcarolina)|[Arkansas](#f/arkansas)


The winner of each of these 8 pods based on *this week alone* will advance to their respective final.

If any of the scoring is confusing, don't worry about it, just do your best on the quiz, as it can only help your team!

As a reminder, the 64 Semifinalists next week will be composed of:

* 16 First Round Byes
* The 47 best performers out of ranks 17-255 *based on this week alone*.
* The best individual (Cinderella) not in the top 255 *based on this week alone*.

The top 5 of [Wisconsin](#f/wisconsin), [Michigan](#f/michigan), [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech), [Penn State](#f/pennstate), and [Stanford](#f/stanford) remain unchanged, while [Northwestern](#f/northwestern) has usurped [Clemson](#f/clemson) in sixth. [California](#f/california) and [William & Mary](#f/williammary) have qualified for the Premier Playoff in the last week. Every Premier Playoff team has been in the Premier Tier for at least one playoff, but this is only the second trip for [Kentucky](#f/kentucky), [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia), and [Baylor](#f/baylor).

[Fresno State](#f/fresnostate), [Utah](#f/utah), and [Rutgers](#f/rutgers) lead the Shootyhoops TimeOut Tier. [ULM](#l/ulm) and [Georgia State](#l/georgiastate) have joined the hunt in their last week. Alongside them, [Wake Forest](#f/wakeforest) has qualified for their first ever playoff!

With the [Preseason Coaches' Poll](/r/CFB/comments/6rd5kp/preseason_coaches_poll/) out and /u/dybuell's beautiful [illustration of the Head Coaches Tree](http://i.imgur.com/jvy9ZmL.png) fresh on my mind, I thought it would be fun to design a ""multilevel"" coaches' poll that incorporates the hierarchy of the tree. 

Unfortunately, the only poll that releases the votes publicly is the final regular season poll, so we can't do it for preseason or post CFP. Taking that poll, I weighted the scores by the number of head coaches in the poll in a coach's tree. This only factors in relationships in which *both* FBS coaches are in the poll and voted that week. The poll last year had 64 members of which 58 voted in week 14. There are a few edge cases like Tom Herman was listed on the ballot but had already moved on to Texas, and so I counted it for Major Applewhite.

Let's look at Rich Rodriguez as an example. He gets a weight of 4 for his own ballot, and then has 1 immediate descendant, David Beaty, so he gets 3 more for his ballot. He then has 4 more 2nd generation descendants, Gus Malzahn, Mike Norvell, Jay Norvell, and Major Applewhite (all through Todd Graham), and gets 2 points a piece for them, for a total weight of 15. The lowest weighted ballot is 4 (just their own ballot), and the highest was Urban Meyer with 19. 

Here is the full table of both the multilevel score and rank and the actual score and rank.

This *Sequioa Sempervirens* is estimated to have sprouted in 940 AD, and is the 2nd historical landmark to be registered in the state of California. It was a frequent campsite for the local Ohlone, and marked the discovery by Gaspar de Portolà, who led Spain's first expedition from San Diego to San Francisco in 769, of the San Francisco Bay. At the time the tree was 135.7 feet tall. It grew to a maximum of 162.2 feet and is currently 110 feet. 

The local town of Palo Alto is named after this tree, and it features on both the [Stanford Academic Seal](https://identity.stanford.edu/overview/images/emblems/SU_SealColor_web3.png) and the [City of Palo Alto logo](http://my.solarroadmap.com//userfiles/Palo_Alto_CA-logo.jpg). Seeds from El Palo Alto were flown on STS-51F, the penultimate successful Challenger mission in 1985, and have been planted into 6 trees in [Challenger Memorial Grove](http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=116&TargetID=14) near campus. The tree itself is just over a mile from Stanford Stadium, and while it can't quite be seen from the stadium, it can from nearby Hoover Tower.

The history of the [Stanford Tree](https://campusriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Stanford-Tree-Mascot-Monday.jpg) as an unofficial mascot is that the old mascot, the Stanford Indian, and particularly the human mascot ""Prince Lightfoot"" were deemed behind the times, and so President Lyman officially got rid of the mascot and reverted to the 1930 team name, Stanford Cardinal. A 1975 student referendum for a new nickname was headlined by Robber Barons, Sequoias, Trees, Cardinals (plural), Railroaders, Spikes, and Huns. Robber Barons won the student vote, but was not accepted by administrators. In protest, LSJUMB (the Stanford Band) held a halftime parody show proposing three new mascots, the Steaming Manhole, the French Fry, and the Tree. While the first two were offhand jokes, the latter drew serious interest and support, and has been the unofficial mascot ever since. This past Spring both the band and the Tree have been pulled into more official university control, which may take away some of the charm of the position, but also adds a new layer of legitimacy.

While live mascots are typically from the animal kingdom, our plant mascot has played an integral role in the history of the region extending far before Stanford, college football, the state of California, or the United States, and has shaped many aspects of university culture.","The Closest Thing Stanford has to a Live Mascot is El Palo Alto, a 1077-year-old Coast Redwood"

Inspired by a [1993 Nike Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy9ReaXIvHc), the movie coincided with Jordan's return to the NBA in 1996 and was a surprise hit, receiving middling reviews but owning the box office and winning over the hearts and minds of a generation. The [1996 website](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm) is still up and unedited. There's been mass demand among fans for a sequel but for over two decades we've been left empty handed. Part of the challenge is finding a worthy successor to Jordan's legacy.

The only person who could legitimately take up the mantle is LeBron James. He's shaken off the antipathy he earned from the controversy surrounding The Decision^TM, and could legitimately contend with Jordan for GOAT in a few years. His media company, SpringHill Entertainment, made waves in 2015 when they signed a [broad contract with Warner Brothers](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lebron-james-springhill-entertainment-signs-810489), that many suspected could lead to a Space Jam sequel. Rumors picked up steam last summer [when a writer was attached](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/space-jam-sequel-finds-director-834978), but nothing concrete has come out of the rumors yet. Or have they? Let's pick up at the end of Space Jam.

Jordan, Bill Murray, and the Tune Squad defeat the Nerdlucks, Barkley, Ewing, Bradley, Johnson, and Bogues get their powers back, and the Nerdlucks, free from the grip of Mr. Swackhammer, join the Looney Toons and live in peace. Mr. Swackhammer is forced into Wile E. Coyote's rocket and blasted off the planet, to the Moon rather than back to his home on Moron Mountain. Jordan returns to the NBA, and wins three more championships. We're now in 1998.

Consider another '90s movie, [The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brave_Little_Toaster_Goes_to_Mars). This was a sequel to the 1987 classic, The Brave Little Toaster, and both were based on children's books by the same name by Thomas Disch. The stories revolve around sentient appliances going on adventures and warding off obsolescence. In the original film, the appliances belong to a Rob, a child who sees the appliances at a summer cottage. The film takes place as he's going off to college and they try not to get lost in the mix. 9 years later in the sequel, Rob is newly married with a young baby, Robbie, and through a series of strange events, the appliances and young Robbie are transported to Mars. There they discover a misanthropic race of appliances, angry at humanity for abandoning them on Mars, and hell-bent on destroying Earth with a rocket.

Back to Space Jam. Mr. Swackhammer is jettisoned on the Moon with nothing but a rocket in 1996. No food, no oxygen, it seems like a death sentence, but then we remember that his species has one key ability: absorbing the powers of things around them. The implication offscreen is that if Mr. Swackhammer is to survive, he imbues himself in the rocket and becomes the rocket, because that's the only thing he can do. The Moon is uninhabited, and he doesn't have the resources to take on Earth yet, so the logical thing to do would be to go to its planetary neighbor, Mars, and recoup.

Swackrocket gets to Mars and is delighted to find a race of machines that are also angry at humanity. He manipulates them into the events leading up to the Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars, and becomes the rocket that's going to destroy Earth, his final act of revenge. When Toaster and Hearing Aid cancel the launch with 1 second to go, Swackrocket ignites, and then crashes harmlessly on the launchpad. The screen cuts away to the departing spaceship with the other appliances who figure out how to save the Toaster. 

In the minute in which they've cut away from the Toaster, the rocket is crashed on the pad, and is no longer a useful vessel for Mr. Swackhammer to inhabit. Out of options again, he imbues himself in the only available animate object, the Brave Little Toaster. This happens off camera, and so when we cut back to the rescue of the Toaster and the gang going back to Earth with baby Robbie, it's actually Mr. Swackhammer in the Toaster. Back on Earth, he sees that his old nemesis Michael Jordan has just won his 6th championship. He makes it his singular goal to infiltrate the NBA and beat Jordan at his own game, and only then will he truly have peace. But how can he possibly do so as a Toaster owned by an infant?

Baby Robbie grows, and loses the ability to understand appliances. When he turns 5, he starts going by Ronnie now to avoid confusion with his dad. Careful not to be observed as animate during the day, Swacktoaster whispers subliminal messages while Ronnie sleeps about basketball to ensure he becomes a basketball fan. Unfortunately his local team, the Golden State Warriors, are godawful for Ronnie's entire childhood. They make exactly one playoff while he's growing up, in 2006, and lose in the second round. But Ronnie loves the Warriors, as he inherits his dad's sentimentality for washed up appliances that still have life in them, and as a wry joke, puts a Golden State sticker on his toaster, since both the Dubs and the toaster are items that had their best days in the '70s. 

But then miraculously they start actually getting good in 2012. After years of haplessness, the Warriors are on a tear, and win their first championship of Ronnie's life in 2015. They break the best regular season record set by Jordan's Bulls the following year, but lose a rematch to LeBron in the Finals. The 2016-17 season progresses and seems hell-bent towards a third straight Warriors-Cavs Final, and Swacktoaster finally has his in. With the controversial acquisition of Kevin Durant, he sees much of what he admired about his original Monstars in the Warriors, and the spirit of his nemesis Michael Jordan in LeBron James. Swacktoaster subliminally persuades a now adult Ronnie to go to an autograph signing in [San Francisco in March, 2017](/r/nba/comments/5zeamf/xpost_from_rwarriors_klay_thompson_signed_my/). Ronnie takes the item he for some reason associates most with basketball, his toaster. After two decades of being trapped in a humble bread-brazing appliance, Swacktoaster finds himself touching one of the NBA's great stars in Klay Thompson. What you see in [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/trgB2s6.jpg) is not confusion, but possession, for it is at that moment that Swackthompson takes over. Ronnie posts the interaction under his Reddit handle, /u/RDollaz, on /r/nba, and the now de-Swacked Toaster quickly reaches viral status as the Warriors keep winning.

The Warriors go on a tear, with the vengeful Swackthompson no longer watching from on high as a manager, but right in the thick of it as a key player with his new Monstars. He uses everything he learned from Barkley, Ewing, Bradley, Johnson, and Bogues, and the Warriors go 31-1 in games that Swackthompson plays. This includes a 12-0 run of 3 consecutive playoff sweeps before meeting LeBron and the Cavs in the Finals. The Cavs manage to win a game, but Swackthompson and the Warriors win 4-1. Swackthompson is not only a Champion, but he's a beloved star of a globally recognized phenomenon.

Swackhammer's first plan aimed to steal from humanity, but came from a place of greed and failed. His second plan was to destroy humanity, but came from a place of wrath, and also failed. His third plan was to become humanity, and through cunning patience, he earned his victory.

## Major Notes

* You get a 1 point **speed bonus** for finishing in 2.5 minutes or under.

Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by me, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, /u/swanky-k, and /u/UATitan. Each week there will be 5 questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. 

There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance.

## Major Notes

* [Michigan](#f/michigan3-sheet1-row04-col19) Winged Helmet Trophy Flair is now active and claimable from https://flair.redditcfb.com! The flair selector has been slightly upgraded too.
* This is the first week of the Summer Season, everyone is tied for first!
* You get a 1 point **speed bonus** for finishing in 2.5 minutes or under.

Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by me, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, /u/swanky-k, and /u/UATitan. Each week there will be 5 questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. 

There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance.

## [Last Week](/r/CFB/comments/6e7uq2/trivia_tuesday/)

Last week was just a fun week between Trivia seasons that consisted of meta trivia about /r/CFB itself. No perfect scores, but we had 3 users score 5 points with /u/MetropolitanVanuatu, /u/slugmos, and /u/JGibel. Congrats!

Yet again the Intersession Team championship went to a new team, with National Champions [Clemson](#f/clemson) winning! [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) and [Michigan](#f/michigan) were close behind.

*Best of luck to all!*

## Major Notes

* [Michigan](#f/michigan) has won the Premier Championship!
* /u/ventolin_3, /u/dallasw3, and /u/LouHoltzSplashZone were the top 3 Individuals.
* **This is just a fun week between seasons.** It is focused on meta trivia about /r/CFB rather than about College Football.

Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by me, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, /u/swanky-k, and /u/UATitan. Each week there will be 5 questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. 

There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance.

## [Last Week](/r/CFB/comments/6cv6cu/trivia_tuesday/)

We still have yet to have a perfect 11 in the exceptionally hard Final week of each season! /u/ventolin_3 came close with a 9, and /u/patato, /u/ctetc2007, and /u/nbingham196 were just behind with an 8.

As a Finalist, /u/ventolin_3 is also our individual champion! /u/dallasw3 came in 2nd with 7, and /u/LouHoltzSplashZone made the podium with 6 points. /u/JEMicklos was in 4th place also with 6 points but a bit slower time. Special commendation for this week goes to /u/Rex_Burkhead with 6 points, the highest score to get the speed bonus, and /u/westcoastwildcat, the only Finalist to get the speed bonus.

/u/ventolin_3 had the highest total points on the season with 65, followed closely by Finalist /u/THECrew42 and Semifinalist /u/ctetc2007 at 62, and Semifinalist /u/whitedawg at 60. /u/Rex_Burkhead, /u/LordMayorOfCologne, and /u/DevilGhoti at 59. /u/xochihuehuetl holds the honor as the highest scoring Individual to be the sole representative from their team, Tulane, in 8th overall. We'd also like to commend /u/nolehusker for retaining their crown for the highest ratio of weeks played to points scored that played all 12 weeks this season for persistence.

In a title showdown between perennial trivia finalists [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate), [Stanford](#f/stanford), [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech), and [Michigan](#f/michigan), the Wolverine team of /u/patato, /u/Rex_Burkhead, /u/Mark_DeToff, /u/ktffan, and /u/BigBoutros scored a total of 96 points to win the Premier Tier, regaining [Michigan](#f/michigan)'s Trophy flair after a one season hiatus! In addition to these 5 who performed very well on the Final, /u/drotter1, /u/patato, /u/TMP3407, /u/TheTeamCubed, /u/JumpingJays led the team to the final over the course of the season. Because of how involved it is to send a poll to all Michigan voters, we'll use the results from the previous vote and restore the Winged Helmet as a third flair option unless there are strong objections. The Stanford S flair with a white tree will be decommissioned for now. [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) came in 2nd this past week, [Stanford](#f/stanford) in 3rd, and [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech) in 4th. Incredibly, taking the combined team score over the season [Stanford](#f/stanford) and [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) were absolutely tied at 212 points, with the tiebreaker going to [Stanford](#f/stanford) for a higher scoring 6th place.

In the Shootyhoops Championship Tier, the [Fresno State](#f/fresnostate) team of /u/longsnapper77 and /u/eagledogwon beat out [Utah](#f/utah), [Missouri](#f/missouri), and [Marshall](#f/marshall) to win the title. We'll rename the tier the Bulldog Championships Tier, but are open to other suggestions, feel free to add some in the comments below!

[William & Mary](#f/williammary) was once again the top non-FBS team in 53rd overall, while [Rice](#f/rice) was the top non-P5 in 30th. A valiant performance by the two-person team of /u/MNBLIZZARD and /u/dick_mallrats led D3 [St. John's (MN)](#f/stjohnsmn-sheet3-row11-col07) to the postseason good for 58th place! We had a total of 2415 individuals from 200 teams play this season.

Thanks for being a part of another great Trivia season! We hope you enjoy the Summer Season, and once it finishes we will have football :)

*Best of luck to all!*

The Toronto Blue Jays remain the last Canadian team to win a World Series, NBA Championship, Stanley Cup, or MLS Cup Final. They did so in both 1992 and 1993 with a dominant team, just beating out the Montreal Canadiens' 1993 Stanley Cup win. The poor Expos by all rights had a great shot at the 1994 title that was cut short by strike. 

But wait you say, there is a sixth major professional sporting league in North America, the CFL! Canadian football is a fascinating sport that is well worth a watch that currently only has Canadian teams, just as the NFL only has teams from the US. What many people don't realize is that during the '90s, the CFL had an ultimately unsuccessful expansion attempt into the US, but successfully formed teams in Baltimore, Las Vegas, Sacramento, Shreveport, San Antonio, Birmingham, and Memphis. Of these, the most successful was the Baltimore Stallions, who won the Grey Cup in 1995. [This is a great writeup](http://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/baltimore-stallions-oral-history/). 

Sadly, soon after winning, the Ravens moved to Baltimore, and the Stallions folded. In the time since the Blue Jays won their last World Series, the following Canadian teams have been eligible for major titles:

The Jays are starting to come back a bit after a very rough start.

## Major Notes

* This is the Finals of the Spring Playoffs! 
* There are **10 questions** this week because it is finals. There should be a few that are accessible to a broad audience, but they will be harder on average.
* You get a 1 point speed bonus for completing the quiz in under **5 minutes**.
* 16 individuals are competing for the individual title, as well as 8 teams!

Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by me, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, /u/swanky-k, and /u/UATitan. Each week there will be 5 questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. 

There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance.

## [Last Week](/r/CFB/comments/6bhyxz/trivia_tuesday/)

After several weeks with a dearth of perfect scores we had 44 last week! Congrats to:

Among these were 18 semifinalists, and the 16 fastest of them advance to the finals this week, including /u/THECrew42, /u/ventolin_3, /u/westcoastwildcat, /u/LouHoltzSplashZone, /u/nicesausage, /u/dallasw3, /u/xochihuehuetl, /u/meristematic, /u/DevilGhoti, /u/gonoles287, /u/EmeraldOrbis, /u/A-Stu-Ute, /u/JEMicklos, /u/Aeschylus_, /u/eagledog, and /u/LordMayorOfCologne. Hokie teammates /u/dirkthesexytoddler and /u/VPI97 were also Semifinalists with perfect scores, but weren't quite fast enough to make the Final. A special commendation goes to /u/eagledog, the first Cinderella contestant to advance all the way to the Final.

[Ohio State Ball](#i/ohiostateball) [Stanford Ball](#i/stanfordball) [Virginia Tech Ball](#i/virginiatechball) [Michigan Ball](#i/michiganball) 

In the Premier Tier, went fairly predictably, with top seeds [Stanford](#f/stanford), [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech), and [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) advancing to the Final and winning their Bowls. Perennial champ [Michigan](#f/michigan) was technically the 2nd seed in the [Sugar](#l/sugar) behind [Northwestern](#f/northwestern), but cruised to a win and will rejoin the Final. [Texas A&M](#f/texasam) was the 4th best team last week, exactly one point ahead of Finalist [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech), but did not win their pod and so will not advance. These 4 Finalist teams collectively account for a total of 13/20 Trivia Tuesday Final bids.

The winner based on this week alone will get the exclusive ability to have an extra alternate flair for as long as they can defend their Trivia Trophy. [Stanford](#f/stanford) currently has it, and so if they do not win, they will drop back down to 2. [Michigan](#f/michigan) could regain their third flair, [Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) could earn a *fourth* flair, and if [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech) wins they will keep their first ever alternate flair permanently.

[Utah Ball](#i/utahball) [Fresno State Ball](#i/fresnostateball) [Marshall Ball](#i/marshallball) [Missouri Ball](#i/missouriball)

In the Shootyhoops Championship Tier, Top Seeds [Utah](#f/utah), [Fresno State](#f/fresnostate), and [Marshall](#f/marshall) all won their pod to advance to the Final. Dark horse [Missouri](#f/missouri) won the [Peach](#l/peach) and will join them in the Final. [BYU](#f/byu) and [Iowa State](#f/iowastate) both had solid performances that would have put them ahead of [Missouri](#f/missouri) but they lost their pod to [Marshall](#f/marshall). 

If any of the scoring is confusing, don't worry about it, just do your best on the quiz, as it can only help your team!

*Best of luck to all!*

I thought it would be nice to have this in a pretty, sortable table. Major notes:

* 2nd and 3rd place votes for players not on the top 3 teams are imputed. There are other combinations of votes that could be correct here since we won't have the full data until the show, but this is a good approximation. Example: instead of each having 2 2nd place votes and 8 3rd place votes, Kyrie Irving could have (1,11) and Klay Thompson could have (3,5).
* While the Guards are all sorted, several F/Cs may have been voted in different positions by different voters. I did my best approximation for people on the borders, but the numbers don't add up exactly per category (I suspect several if not all of Draymond's 1st place votes had him at C, not F).",Table of All-NBA Player Voting

2 perfect scores last week, congrats to /u/GoldenEagle2324 and /u/fo13! /u/xochihuehuetl and /u/A-Stu-Ute are the final 2 individuals to enter contention for the Top 16 and have earned themselves a first round bye. The other 14 are /u/THECrew42, /u/whitedawg, /u/ventolin_3, /u/ctetc2007, /u/westcoastwildcat, /u/Shellshock1122, /u/longsnapper77, /u/TDenverFan, /u/EmeraldOrbis, /u/dallasw3, /u/DevilGhoti, /u/mookiexpt2, /u/LouHoltzSplashZone, and /u/nicesausage. All 16 are guaranteed a pass to the Individual Semifinal next week, but may be essential to their team's success this week. The cutoff for the top 16 was 39 points, or an average of 4.33. The cutoff for the Top 255 Playoff qualifiers was 27 points and 1:46.98, or exactly 3 points per week. /u/TheRamblaGambla holds the honor of being the best user not to qualify, being just 0.31 seconds too slow on average with 27 points and 1:47.29.

As a reminder, the 64 Semifinalists next week will be composed of:

* 16 First Round Byes
* The 47 best performers out of ranks 17-255 *based on this week alone*.
* The best individual (Cinderella) not in the top 255 *based on this week alone*.

Like the Missouri Valley, the Horizon would be incentivized to add a 10th (or maybe 10th, 11th, and 12th) member. They could stay at 9, but it seems unlikely.

1565,3sch0,200909,False,False,True,True,bakonydraco,22200,bakonydraco,641dri,2017-04-07 19:19:10,3.0,4.0,"With Wichita moving to the AAC and kicking off the latest round of realignment, most here are probably familiar with the quixotic midmajor that has captured hearts and minds at the NCAA Tournament especially over this last decade. I think many are probably less familiar with the largest city in the Sunflower State. Despite its size, it has less national recognition than the capital Topeka and the metropolitan Kansas City area. It's a deeply misunderstood city, and I'm going to try to shed some light on it through the lens of the 1999 film *[The Big Kahuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Kahuna_\(film\))*, set in Wichita.

The film really only has 3 actors, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, and Peter Facinelli. It was adapted from the stageplay *Hospitality Suite* by Roger Rueff, who also authored the play. The film centers around 3 salesmen for an industrial supply firm who are visiting Wichita for a trade show. The products their company sells, industrial lubricants, sealing wax, and solvents, are largely irrelevant to the story, but kind of a reverse McGuffin in that the characters are trying to sell them instead of find them. Their goal throughout the film is to meet with the titular ""Big Kahuna"", the CEO of a large company that could save their firm from bankruptcy. They strategize how to arrange a meeting with the CEO and make a sale to him as efficiently as possible.

There are a lot of parallels with both Wichita the city and the basketball team here. Despite being known for wheat and agriculture (aided by [this guy](http://imgur.com/8Es0yjL.png)), Wichita has earned the nickname it uses of ""The Air Capital of the World"", and is the home to Beechcraft, Cessna, and a significant center for Learfield, Airbus, and Spirit. The city has lofty ambitions and always seeks to fly higher. Similarly, the basketball team has perhaps outperformed the conference it's in more than any other D1 team in the country. For Wichita the city, the elusive Big Kahuna is the recognition as a bustling modern center of technology rather than a provincial farm town. For the basketball team, it's the acceptance to a major conference that's more appropriate for their level of play, that would put an end to the days of #37 overall seed with #10 KenPom ranking. That day has finally come for the basketball team, and maybe it's coming for the city, too.

Back to the film, the youngest of the salesmen, a devout Baptist named Bob, does get a meeting with the CEO, but uses the time to discuss religion rather than the products they are selling. While he's well-intentioned, the other salesmen are furious that in a tenuous position for advancement he's blown their one chance at success. There's a fair bit of deep introspection and trying to salvage the situation, but I'll let you watch the film to see whether they do ultimately land the Big Kahuna or not.

What's fascinating here is that it's quite common for authors to inject themselves into a character in their work. Upon another watch, I don't think that's what is going on here. Instead, the author is casting himself as the products being sold, not the salesmen who sell them. The fact that the products are seemingly interchangeable goods is deliberate, as in his journey as an author, even in cases in which he is successful, he feels he's just a piece being pushed around by larger forces for their benefit. So too with Wichita State, this move is undoubtedly in their interest, but they must be aware that they're just a pawn in a much larger game, and their advancement could just as easily have gone to a Dayton or a VCU. It's neither good nor bad, but it's a bit of a sobering layer on the narrative that this does all come down to business decisions.

There's a lot of really interesting parallels here, but the main point I want to leave you with is about the team as a product, not as a protagonist. The metaphor in the film is that the products being sold represent the author, that is, the sealing is the Rueff.",Wichita State: The Big Kahuna

## [Drive Recap](/r/CFB/comments/55oq7r/rcfb_brick_fund_xi_sharing_is_americaring_recap/)

At the beginning of last season we had a fundraiser that raised a total of $6045 to fund bricks at 9 schools, a locker at [ULM](#f/ulm), and a boatload of money for [AmeriCares](http://www.americares.org/). We've just received word from [ULM](#f/ulm) Athletics that an /r/CFB Plaque has been permanently installed over locker #8 in the home locker room. See picture above!

One of the things that was unique about this drive is that ULM was very flexible on what the plaque would look like. They gave us dimensions and composition, and gave us a very wide degree of latitude in how to design it. We went with a simple but elegant sign that read:

## [ULM Ball](#i/ulmball) /r/CFB [/r/CFB](#i/rcfb)

Complete with both /u/Landotej's amazing /r/CFB logo and /u/A-Stu-Ute's Ball specially designed for ULM. Both of these /r/CFB Artists [](#l/artist) can now boast that their artwork is permanently featured in a D1 locker room. After designing the sign, I actually made this with a laser cutter, and shipped it off to ULM. I made [two versions](http://imgur.com/LQKNZ4f.png), one in copper and one in nickel, and ULM thought the silver version you see on the locker was a better match for the other plaques they have.

Huge thanks to ULM for working with us to complete this project, and especially to all 172 donors [](#l/brick) who helped make it a reality!",/r/CFB has a Locker at ULM!

Let It Die is an amazing (if not admittedly rough) game that brings gamers together in a way ive never seen before. Im part of probably one of the smallest divisions in the US (Wyoming, what what!), and this game has actually made me reach out to complete strangers (my team mates) to discuss the game and tactics and such. Not only is the community great, but the developers at Grasshopper Manufacture are genuinely in it for the love of gaming. I've been in a weird mental place for a very very long time and probably not a good one, I'll say that. Often i turn to reddit as a way to escape my mental problems somewhat. Another sub i go to, /r/NoMansHigh , is a wonderful collective of amazing gamers and friends too but it was the only sub i *really* felt welcome at. Then LET IT DIE came out and i searched up the sub. ""Holy crap, this game only has 55 subscribers? It looks amazing and hilarious!"". That was about four or five days before we got the surprise release, and in those days i talked to some very kickass people here. Not only kickass, but a lot of people that were either down in the dumps or just grumpy at life. Lifted me up a lot, as selfish as it seems to type that. But I'd also like to think i lifted some others up through pm's and all that, jus to somewhat return the favor. Ive also recently been trying to become better at editing and creating videos, as im tied down at my house almost 24/7. The stimulation this place and its inhabitants  kicked me was unbelievable, and i was inspired in a weird way. So i made a fan trailer of the game, complete with copyright-free wubadub-step and rough editing, and released it onto you all (shameless plug:  https://youtu.be/fPPEn7qsmi4) and received very kind words from many of you! **YES I TOTALLY REALIZE THE MUSIC DOESN'T FIT THE GAME AT ALL**, I'm going to make a new trailer after i progress in the game today, im going to showcase better kills hopefully and definitely pick a better song.

I had a couple rolls of 120 Tri-X that expired in 1983 that I loaded up. Here's my question: I have a metering app on my phone that I used, with the ISO set to 1600. With a 2.8 lens I ended up shooting at 1/60th for almost all the exposures, with a few a little slower. It was hard to get a consistent reading from the meter; bright lights to the back and top of the stage, and hardly any illuminating the band from the front, so I'm not entirely sure what to expect when I see the negatives.

I've never shot film *this* old before and have heard about the +1 stop for every decade rule, and that, coupled with the fact that I'm not sure if the subjects will have had enough exposure, leads me to wonder if I should tell the lab to develop at 3200 and not 1600... I'm just worried about getting a bunch of thin negatives back.

I've recorded an album in a similar fashion before, but was wondering if anyone had suggestions on ways to do this better. Last time, we had to do some careful slip editing because a couple beats here and there did not sync up well enough. My main reservation is that the click track will rob some of the organic push-and-pull feel of the tempo that exists with really slow, heavy, sludgy music... if that makes sense.

I was able to score an old Mapex kit (just the toms and kick), and am looking to pick up some cymbals for a minimalist rock setup. I can play alright but know nothing about gear, but I read through the FAQs and such so I have a basic idea. I'll get a deep snare as well but that should be easier to figure out. Looking to get a crash that I can also ride (for some heavy stoner type stuff), another crash, a ride, and hats. 

I think most of the stuff I'll be playing is slow, downtuned stuff. Bands like Electric Wizard, Sleep, Sabbath, etc. Does anyone have any input on what sizes of these I should be looking for to best suit this kind of music? Does it even matter? I'm on a pretty tight budget, but I'm also definitely willing to consider things out of the usual setup (really large ones, or different materials, or whatever).

Instead of a barren wasteland, she discovers a garden paradise and a mutant war that changes everything.

I've been doing a lot of research, but that just makes my anxiety worse, so I thought talking to others with Marfan's would be a better way to learn more. If you feel comfortable, please share your experiences with me. 

Here's my experience if you're curious: 

Growing up I got made fun of a lot for being tall and lanky. By my sophomore year of high school, I was 6' even and 125 pounds (female). My entire family is very tall and athletic though, and I didn't have any noticeable symptoms until my mid-twenties. 

I played varsity basketball, ran track and cross-country, and even served for four years in US Army Special Operations. My drill sergeants called me fragile, but I didn't let that stop me. I've always been super flexible and dextrous, but otherwise I athleticism did not come naturally to me. Unlike the rest of my family, even though my legs are forever long, running was always hard. With a lot of effort and practice, I was above average, but never excelled. Now I know it's because my heart and lungs have issues. 

I was medically discharged from the military for plantar fasciitis and scoliosis, then I went to college at age 23. My junior year, my lung collapsed for the first time. I thought I was having a heart attack, but when my EKG came back normal, they did an X-ray and found the pneumothorax. It was mild enough that it healed on its own. My doctors couldn't find the cause.

Five years and three collapses later, my mother (a nurse) told a doctor friend about my condition. He asked her to describe me, and he basically diagnosed me without ever meeting me. Thank goodness for that man. 

I hadn't told anyone yet because I thought it was just hypochondria, but I'd noticed heart palpitations, subtle chest pain, and fatigue for the past several months, as well as dizziness when running and lifting weights. 

When my mom told me I might have Marfan's, my initial google search convinced me I didn't have it. The pictures I found were of very severe cases, and I thought there was no way. But still, I did my due diligence as a hypochondriac and did more research. A few hours later and I was concerned enough to schedule an appointment with my primary care physician. 

He asked me a few questions about my lung collapses, heart problems, and then asked me to do some stretches with my hands/thumbs. He said he was pretty sure I had it, and referred me to a cardiologist. My EKG was still normal, but he was concerned enough to order further testing. My echocardiogram and MRA revealed mild regurgitation (leakage I guess) and mild thickening of the aorta. 

He told me to quit drinking alcohol and coffee, lower my physical exertion but still do yoga and light weights/cardio, eat healthy, and get on beta blockers. I said I wanted to do more research before getting on medication for the rest of my life, but now I regret it. I'm still worried about potential side effects (the list is pretty terrifying) but every time I have chest pain I'm afraid I'm going to die. So I guess in January I'll probably get on beta blockers and hope for the best. One of my life goals is to live to be 150, so medical technology better hurry up and improve!

What's your story? I don't want my novel's character to be just like me, so I want the full picture. Thanks!","I recently found out I have Marfan's Syndrome, and it inspired my next book, but I need your help!"

My new story is in the same genre (YA sci-fi), but I wrote the first chapter in first person present tense and with a more familiar/relaxed style. Is that okay?

I know quite a few readers that are very particular about the POV. I don't want to lose any by changing things up with my new book.

Part of my writing process is to crank out the basic story as quickly as possible (I blame Nanowrimo) and then flesh out the details and add a few scenes during revisions. 

However, even with that in mind it's still shorter than my first book. Here's the breakdown:

First book - 1st draft: 60,000 words. 2nd draft: 77,000 words. Final draft after editing: 74,000 words. 

If I follow that same formula...

Sequel - 1st draft: 54,000 words. 2nd draft: 71,000 words? Final draft: 68,000 words?

This subreddit and /r/YAwriters have always been a great help to me on my writer's journey and I don't want to hide my progress now. 

I published my first book in January with a somewhat questionable small press. Many told me not to do it, but I don't regret it. I wanted to sign my first contract before the age of 30. I wanted to get my story out there. I wanted to go on a book tour and hold my book in my hands without having to self-publish or pay for it. 

I was getting full-requests from agents and other small presses, but when I got an offer from this company, I took it. They do have some negativity in their history and no major bestsellers, but they aren't a scam, nor are they a vanity... although I will concede that they are basically a hybrid. 

I don't know if I should be ashamed of that. I don't know if I should stay with them for the rest of my planned trilogy or let my contract expire next year and move on. 

To be clear, I haven't paid them anything. They have no requirement to pay for any service in order to be published, nor is there a requirement to buy copies of my own books. They paid for my cover, editing, formatting, distribution, set up my Amazon page, made my ebook available on several platforms, and did a small PR campaign (email list, promo discount, and I've seen a few ads floating around the internet). I got a small number of ARCs. I didn't get an advance, but they have sent me two modest royalty checks. They always respond when I ask for an update on sales. Finally, their name has gotten me into book signings in Barnes & Nobles and conventions in four states, and I don't feel like I'm lying when I tell people I'm a published author. 

However, I do have to set up my own events and pay for extra promotional items at my own discretion. I chose to buy a banner and bookmarks from a third-party company. I've set up at least a dozen events and I've paid for a handful of Facebook ads. I think I've broken even in this first year. 

They do have optional services like boosted PR campaigns or spots at book festivals. For example, they offer a spot on NetGalley for $100, which is normally 3-4 times that amount for solo authors. I've never paid for any of that stuff, but some of the authors I know swear by it. 

This publisher isn't perfect, but I achieved my original goals. I wasn't a breakout hit and I'm not even close to quitting my day job, but my book has positive reviews, I've sold a few hundred copies, done a book tour, and had the pleasure of meeting a ton of new people who seem to really enjoy my reading and look forward to the sequel. All by the age of 30, which for whatever reason was important to me at the time. Now I'm 31 and I wonder why it mattered so much, but that's another issue for a different time. 

I recently met an agent at a writing convention and told her my story. She recommended that I stick with this publisher for my current series. She said that I was off to a ""modest"" start, and even told me to query her with my next project and mention our conversation. 

That should encourage me, but then I see threads that make me feel self-conscious and stupid for signing one book over to them, let alone another. I've heard them described as a ""back-end vanity press"" or worse. My personal experience with them hasn't been bad, but how will that reputation affect my career?

My new goal is to get an agent with my next project and take my career to a higher level. With that in mind, should I abandon this publisher mid-series and either self-publish the rest or find a different small press? Is that even an option? If I wait out my contract, what are the odds another publisher will want to pick up a previously published series? Dropping the series altogether is not an option. I'm already almost finished with the sequel and people are begging me to release it. What do I dooooo?",Should I stay or should I go?

- Type the poems. 

- Revise and edit them.

- Get feedback. 

- Submit a few individual poems and try to get published in a magazine or collection. To my knowledge, it's really difficult for anyone to publish a book of their poetry, much less an unknown debut. 

- Query agents. 

- Or self-publish it. (Pay for editing, etc.)

I have a ton of pictures on my blog if anyone is interested. Here's a run-down of how it went:

- The panel went really well. There were four of us; first we introduced ourselves and our books. I was really nervous for that part, but after I got my feet wet I was fine. After that we played a game where the crowd called out a random number and we each read that page of our books. We went with '42' which just so happened to be the start of a new Chapter, so it was perfect. Then we took a few questions about the writing process, tropes, challenges, and we finished by talking about the publishing process. We had great chemistry as a group, the crowd was a good size but not overwhelming, and I didn't die from anxiety.

- I brought 50 copies of my book. I sold 43.

- Barnes & Noble sold 10 additional copies at their booth, asked me to sign the rest of their stock, and will be selling them in-store. They also asked me to contact their event coordinator to set up a signing and schedule an appearance at their YA event this summer.

- I met another Amarillo author, NY Times Best Seller A.G. Howard. We spent about 15 minutes talking before our panel and she gave me some great advice. Afterwards she told me I did an amazing job and said she knew I'd do well as an author. 

- I became friends with my two booth-neighbors, fellow Texas authors Holly Hudspeth and Crissy Smith. Holly and I traded books and agreed to review/promote each others' work. Holly gave me a lot of great advice and complimented my public speaking and pitching skills.

- I met an audiobook voice artist and comic book artist who both expressed interest in working with me.

- I met two librarians who bought my book and gave me information on how to get my book in the city library and book club.

- I met the board members for the Comic Con in Lubbock and they invited me to the next event. They were also members of the Rebel Legion/501st and encouraged me to join as Princess Leia. I'm definitely going to get involved. I had no idea they did charity work in addition to cosplay. So cool!

- I had a blast talking to everyone and taking pictures with all the cosplayers. 

- I now have 10 5-star reviews on Amazon. Off to a good start!

- It snowed all day Saturday and part of Sunday, so the crowd might've been a little lighter than usual. It was still pretty steady though.

Overall I had a fantastic time. I'll definitely be making appearances at more Comic Cons in the future. :-)",My takeaways from my first author event!

2.) What's the best way to maintain consistency (voice, characters, little details).

3.) I think I talked a little about this before, but I'm not sure. Neither my beta readers, critique partners, current readers, nor my editor/publisher have said anything about this, but since I've started reading more YA sci-fi I've noticed my book bucks a pretty major trend and I'm second-guessing it. 

Basically, I've noticed that most YA sci-fi books keep the setting pretty simple (one major location with only a handful of secondary locations, usually close-by). I think I was more heavily influenced by fantasy novels when I came up with the story... I have seven locations-- from a lunar colony to a city on the bottom of the sea (plus minor travel scenes in between).

My plan right now is to continue that to maintain consistency and keep my book unique, but like I said... I'm second guessing myself. In the sequel, the adventure would lead the main character to several new locations and back to one or two from the original.

4.) Should I stay with my indie publisher, try again at finding an agent, or self-publish the rest of my first series (2-4 more books) and then try traditional with my future work? I'm not completely happy or unhappy with my current publisher. It could be better, but it could also be way worse. We did just get a new publicist, so I'm hoping to see more traction build with my debut, but I'm not altogether confident. My main disappointment is the lack of substantial editing.

First, are they important as a part of a debut author's marketing strategy? Is it worth investing money in traveling, paying for stalls at festivals, hotels, food, etc? I was recently told that having a book trailer isn't super important for debut authors, so I'm going to be sure of myself when I plan marketing stuff from now on. :-)

Second, do publishers normally find/schedule events for their authors? My publisher says it will be a ""joint effort."" They periodically send out calendar updates for which festivals they'll be at throughout the year, as well as invitations for authors to join. However, we have to pay for our own stalls (although they do get us discounts). Is that normal? Right now I'm a little unsure how much I want to invest in events. So far my expenses are at $0 (aside from hours of work). Technically I've already made a profit!

Third, my publisher lets authors buy their books at a discounted rate. I do get a small number free, but if I want to sell my books at these events, I think it's my responsibility to have some in stock. Otherwise I will just have to tell people to buy them online or at Barnes and Noble. If it does well, my publisher will start to get it into other stores as well. I thought about bringing a tablet with me so that people can buy them on the spot, but I know a lot of people like to buy print copies that they can have signed right away. I'm a little worried about that idea though; isn't it sort of a pitfall where new authors buy tons of their own books and then spend forever trying to get rid of them? I'm pretty confident my book will sell, but I don't want to fall into that trap. I'm also concerned with what permits I'd need to sell books myself, or how to handle taxes and all that jazz.

Finally, do you have any other tips for me as far as scheduling events goes? My publisher recommends starting locally and going in person with my book in-hand. I've also considered sending a query-type e-mail to event coordinators or managers of local places. I have quiet a few ""fans"" from around Texas (mostly old friends and family, but I'm starting to get more random interest as well). I was thinking about going to a few different cities around the state during my summer break (I've even gotten requests to go to California, Colorado, and Georgia), so I'd want to make plans ahead of time. And again, the issue of cost comes into play. I'm not sure how much I should be doing at this point. By then I'll have a better idea of how well the book sells.

After hearing from everyone here, my beta readers, my CP, and my family, I decided to self-publish my first series (three YA novels). I know that since I've gotten requests and a small press offer, I may have been close to finding an agent for my debut novel. However, there was no guarantee of that, and even if I found a *good* agent, there was no guarantee that my book would be published anytime soon, or even at all. Rather than gamble on uncertainty or forget my book and try again with something new, I chose to pursue self-publishing.

However, after seeing what my teacher pay looks like after benefits, taxes, and student loans are deducted, I realized that self-publishing won't be a viable option for me for at least a year, maybe two. I want to do it the right way and pay for a good editor, cover art, and some marketing. I can't do that right now.

Luckily I got another offer from a different publisher, but it turned out to be even smaller and newer than my first offer. So instead of pursuing it, I e-mailed the old publisher and asked if their offer was still good. I told them my main issue was the fact that their contract was missing the ""all rights not granted to the publisher are retained by the author"" clause, and that if they added that, I would be willing to sign. They added it without hesitation, met all of my other demands, and were professional and prompt throughout the process. I accepted the new contract, signed it on Friday, and sent it to them on Monday.

My book will be published in January of 2017. The publisher will provide the editing, cover-art, formatting, and some marketing services that I couldn't afford myself. I will get to hold printed copies of my book in my hand within six months without investing anything but time. My friends, family, colleagues, and students are happy they will get to read my work soon.

I turned 30 on Saturday. I won't lie, it did feel good to say that I signed my first book contract before my 20s ended. Obviously that wasn't my main motivation, but time *is* a factor. I wanted to publish this book, start building an audience, and move on to the next thing. With the contract negotiations on my side, I am free to write the sequel/prequel and self-publish them if my financial situation improves by then.

Depending on how well this venture goes, I may try publishing traditionally with my next series. However, I do like the idea of self-publishing and having more control, higher royalties, and a quicker process. I could have three books published through this small press or through self-publishing in the time it would take me to get one published traditionally.

To summarize, I chose to sign a contract with a small press for the following reasons: 

- I was able to negotiate the contract in my favor.

- I couldn't afford to self publish. This way I have zero editing, cover-art, formatting, and marketing cost.

- I like how much faster I can publish books via indie/self-publishing.

- I like having more control.

- The publisher is from my home-state, so I will be able to participate in events easily.

- My odds of getting rich and famous via traditional publishing do not outweigh my odds of becoming a successful author via indie publishing.

- If someone out there reads my book and enjoys it, I'll be happy. This is the most efficient path to happiness for me.

Anyway, hopefully you don't all think I'm an idiot. Hopefully at least some of you will be happy for me. Either way, thanks for all of the advice over these past two years. <3",I decided to sign an indie publishing contract...

I already know that if I do it, I want to do it right and invest in a great editor/cover/etc. 

On to the heart of the matter: my revision. I've only really rewritten the whole novel once, although I did chapter and line edits with my CP. I've actually added way more than I've cut out. My first draft was around 60k. It's currently at 77k. Overall I'm happy with what I added, but based on my feedback I discovered two things: I need to get the plot moving a little more quickly in the first chapter, and I need to kill my darlings.

The plot issue in the first chapter is easy.

I'm worried about cutting out some of the things I love in order to make the story better. I've identified what needs to be removed, I just don't know if I can do it.

My book is SFF, so there is a lot of cool technology and it's in the future and all of that, but it also has some fantasy themes- the biggest being that the characters go on a long adventure and visit quite a few incredible settings. I know I don't want to change that completely. My beta readers and CP love the imagery I use to describe the settings and they loved the adventure aspect of the story. I do think there are probably a couple I can remove and either combine with other locations or move to the sequel. 

The other big thing I could cut is one of the main characters. It's the MC's ex. He's the son of the antagonist; he's kind of an asshole at first, he's very flirtatious and cocky, and a bit of a bad boy. Eventually he realizes his dad is a complete psycho, so he teams up with the MC to help her overcome everything. He makes a couple attempts to rekindle their relationship, but she's having none of it, and ends up finding love elsewhere. The ex then focuses on his negative feelings for his father, including pursuing revenge and overthrowing his rule of their lunar colony. He becomes super powerful and angry, which I kind of had fun with. But the MC has a new love interest, a side kick/best friend, and a back-stabbing ally. Eventually it becomes somewhat cumbersome to fit them all into the various conversations and adventures.

I could cut him out completely, or have the backstabbing ally absorb some of his more interesting traits, including his name because I like it better. I could also get rid of the backstabbing ally instead, and have the ex go down a darker path and split off from the main group instead. I can't decide. I actually just came up with that last idea as I typed this. 

I guess I should get around to asking for advice. How do I make these big changes without completely screwing up the story? During my first big revision I rewrote the whole thing, so that wasn't an issue. I'm not sure if I want to risk creating new typos and little mistakes by doing that again... but I don't know how else to maintain the correct sequencing and flow.

I'm also concerned that by cutting out a character and a few locations, I'll cut down my word count too much. I'm pretty happy with my debut YA novel sitting in the upper 70s. Should I be concerned about this? How can I avoid slashing too many words while still making the necessary changes?

Finally, and this will be totally subjective but I love hearing from you guys-- Do my proposed changes sound like they'll benefit the story? I know you have limited information and you can't say for sure without having read the book, but based on what you've seen here or heard me talk about before, should I proceed?

Story/questions:

This is my third spontaneous pneumothorax. I don't have insurance but I will in October. Each time I have had this problem, I went to urgent care, got x-rays, and was told my lung was collapsed but that it wasn't severe. I was told to rest for a few days and take advil for the pain. I had a CT scan done a couple months after the first collapse, but there were no underlying problems or causes. I was told it just happened because I'm very tall/thin and so are my lungs.

This time doesn't feel as bad as the first time, maybe not even as bad as the second time. However, my urgent care doctor this time scared the piss out of me. She tried to call 911, told me I need to go to the ER immediately and get a CT scan done, that this could be life-threatening, etc.

Since I don't have insurance, and none of my doctors ever recommended the ER before, I ignored her. I'm at home resting now. Should I follow her advice and rack up some ER debt, or just wait until I'm insured in October and then follow up with a pulmonary specialist?

Not sure if relevant, but I just started birth control last month, and I'm currently on my period. I've also been very stressed lately due to personal/relationship problems, moving apartments, starting a new career, and financial problems while transitioning jobs. I know that stress can induce pneumothorax, and I've read that periods can contribute as well. Is that true? Can I avoid these issues by using birth control to stop having a period? Would doing yoga to reduce stress help? Would doing more cardio help strengthen my lungs to prevent this? Would you recommend surgery? I have a friend who had it and regrets it.

Themes of finding oneself, awkward romances, etc. No obscene violence or gratuitous sex scenes. Sex may be shown between consenting adults if it drives the plot forward. Target audience: 17 or older.

I sent queries to probably a dozen agents and submitted to about half as many small presses as well. I told myself that if none of them work out, maybe I should skip the long road of traditional publishing and look into paying for an editor and cover artist and then self-publishing instead...

Then I stumbled upon an agent on Twitter that seemed perfect. I looked into their submission guidelines and read their bio and MSWL. It all fit my work. So I decided to try one more for the road. Then I saw their query tip: Paragraph One - Introduction/Book Genre/Word Count/Target Audience. Keep it simple. Paragraph Two - Summarize your story **like you would if you were writing the back cover of your novel** Paragraph Three - Author Bio/Closing.

I knew about the three paragraph structure, but for some reason I had never thought to write my summary like the back cover of a novel. I tried it out.

tl;dr: I'm trying to decide what kind of apocalypse to have in my otherwise already-written story. I need advice on comet impacts and effects. If this is the wrong sub, advice on where to go instead will suffice. Thanks! 

I've already completed the first novel in my series and I just started the sequel. My story takes place 1000 years after an extinction event on Earth that involves most of the planet being uninhabitable for an extended period of time (ranging from decades to centuries depending on the area). My novel is by no means *hard* sci-fi, but I do want to try for accuracy when possible.

When I first started writing, I just imagined it was a nuclear holocaust from WWIII. However after some research I realized that a.) that's way overdone and b.) Earth would only be barren and lifeless for a few years, and probably not everything would go extinct.

So I left the exact nature of the apocalypse ambiguous in the first novel. It's 76,000 words, and has the approval of several beta readers and one critique partner. I'm in the process of querying, and I've had one full request that got me some positive feedback but no offer for request. I'm still querying, but I decided to start the sequel in the meantime.

I can't keep the apocalypse ambiguous forever, so I'm looking for advice to try and make it at least somewhat realistic. I looked into Yellowstone or other Supervolcanoes but ran into the same problem as nukes. Not enough staying power. Next I thought of asteroids, because that has actually caused extinction level-events in Earth's history. But that leaves Earth fucked up for thousands and/or millions of years. 

So I need something between the two. I'm leaning towards a moderately sized comet impact, but I don't know what size would be just right, or how big the crater would be. I want the impact to be in the Colorado Rockies. 

So questions for an extinction that leaves Earth barren for decades-100/200 years:

-How big should the comet be?

-How big should the crater be?

-Would an impact in the Rockies affect Yellowstone?

-Would there be global earthquakes, volcanoes, and nuclear powerplant meltdowns/explosions? (I want this to happen in my book, but only if it makes sense.)",Apocalypse in Sci-Fi

I also thought your villain, Commander Atteran, was a particularly evil and unforgettable character. Ultimately, however, I felt that the dialogue at times came off as a bit stiff at times. Furthermore, I was confused by Vesper's motivations: the day after he and Madi breaks up, he begins dating another girl and later that evening proposes marriage to Madi. His actions were at odds with each other, and I would have liked a better explanation of the inconsistencies in his personality. Given these reservations, I'm afraid I must decline offering representation.

My CP says this is a good rejection. I knew it was a long-shot but I still hoped for the best obviously. I'm sad. I don't think they actually read the whole book though. Later in the story, Vesper's motivation is made more clear, and he tells Madi the proposal wasn't his idea. Instead it was his father's (Atteran) way of manipulating her.

Also while I have your attention, I want thank you all for helping me grow as a writer and learn how to navigate in the publishing world. I wouldn't have made it this far without you guys!

- After participating in #p2p16 last week, one of the editors gave me the advice that I need to get closer in 3rd or switch to 1st. Since then I've had a beta reader binge the whole thing and said they LOVED it, but I've also got a CP going through and making suggestions for making the connection with the MC more apparent. Obviously I won't have time to switch to 1st, but should I take a couple hours to add in a few more ""close"" things like thoughts/feelings of the MC before sending my full MS?

- The agency is Ayesha Pande Literary. It's a 'boutique' agency from New York. It seems legit to me. Anyone here have any experience or recommendations though? 

That's basically all I want to know, but if any of you have other advice please share! I really want to make this happen! ","Just got my first full request, but I have questions!"

I recently entered a contest on Twitter (#p2p16). I got into the game late and all of the YA editors were filled up, but I went ahead and submitted to the sci-fi editors just in case, and hoping that I'd at least get some good feedback.

2 out of 3 of the editors gave me a lot of good feedback, mostly positive. Obviously both passed on my novel since they weren't looking for YA, but they both really liked my work. One moreso than the other. 

The first said in an e-mail: ""Great hook. Super well-written blurb (goal, catalyst, stakes, intriguing plot) that contains elements of Host's Touchstone Trilogy & Bach's Paradox series, both of which I love. Quick glance at pgs: Missed opportunity in 1st par. to introduce idea that MC can't wait to become shuttle pilot & be amongst stars? Also need to mention MC's name in 1st or 2nd par so when dialogue starts we know who's talking. Last thing: catalyst needs to come in pretty early in YA; is it on p. 6? Smooth prose, good worldbuilding. Unfortunately, YA doesn't fit my MSWL.""

The second one gave advice directly on Twitter so I'll just summarize. Her #tenqueries for me said: ""Premise thoughtful and compelling, but I'm hunting Up/LF. Voice needs more volume. Experiment with POV change?"" and then later she offered to answer my questions. She said based on my query feedback (mostly positive) I might not have to revise, but she and the other editors for the contest thought that although I ""have writing chops"" my story might have more urgency and clarity if I switch to 1st person. She recommended I stop querying, read up on more YA in 1st person, and experiment with revising in 1st POV.

I know I can't listen to every critique, but she seemed to know what she was talking about, and she was one of the people in charge of the contest. Plus since someone here or in /r/destructivereaders (can't remember who) suggested trying that as well, I'm wondering if I really should do it.

I've always preferred 3rd person, so that's my main hesitation. But I also thought I was mostly done with big changes to my novel, so I'm a little discouraged at the thought of another complete rewriting. I know it'll be hard to give advice without knowing my story, but any help would be appreciated. I did have one person on Twitter who was reading our conversation offer to read my novel as a critique partner, so I'm sure that will help. But I love hearing from you guys as well.

But they have trouble connecting to my main character. One suggested I change from 3rd person to 1st, especially since I'm writing YA.

But I strongly prefer 3rd person, and I don't like the idea of rewriting the whole thing in a new POV and then having to go through the revision/editing process yet again if I can avoid it. Over in /r/YAwriters they suggested I probably just need to get ""closer"" in 3rd person. I was given an author to read for an example of what that means, but in the meantime I'd like advice on how to get ""close"" in 3rd person.

The Scorching is a Young Adult sci-fi novel complete at 74,000 words. Based on your work with [relevant past clients] you and your readers will love this story.

Desperate, Madi and Vesper steal an experimental shuttle and escape Pax Lunar Colony. They head for her parents’ last known location: their abandoned home-world, Earth. Vesper’s father, the Commander, sends his elite guard to pursue them. Their ship takes damage and they get split up in the resulting crash. At first Madi is glad to be rid of Vesper, but soon realizes she could have used his help. Instead of a barren wasteland, she finds a green paradise. That would normally be a good thing, but she's also stuck on a battlefield between strange humanoid creatures. Just when she thinks things can’t get any weirder, she discovers that she’s not so normal herself. In her fight to avoid the battle, Madi does something beyond bizarre: she uses telekinesis. Before she can track down her family (and Vesper, she guesses), she must learn to use her new abilities to survive.

In addition to writing, I’m also passionate about helping young people; I teach at a Title I High School.

1819,81k2o,11804,False,False,True,False,dibbiluncan,22004,dibbiluncan,3z4qf6,2016-01-02 14:07:21,7.0,0.0,"TL;DR: The book still works without the first two chapters. Should I leave it this way?

I'm writing a YA SF/Fantasy novel. This is my third (or fourth?) rewrite of my first book. The story follows Madi, a teenage girl (college freshman) from the moon. When her parents go missing on an expedition to Earth and her life is threatened for questioning their disappearance, Madi steals a spaceship and heads out to find them. She also happens to be telekinetic/telepathic (like many of her people, who have lived isolated on the moon for 1000 years).

At first, I had written the story so that she and everyone on the moon knew about these powers, but their government prohibited their use. But I realized their technology was sufficient to actively block the use of these powers, so instead I have changed it so that no one even knows they have them. 

Now Madi discovers her powers once she is away from the lunar colony, and they play a big role in her adventure to find her parents and survive (and eventually, to help coordinate a defense strategy against the lunar government, which plans to ""retake"" the Earth).

Anyway, so I was able to edit chapters 3-6 to show her gradually learning about her powers, but chapters 1 and 2 needed a complete overhaul. So I deleted them and sat there thinking of how to start. Then I just started reading from chapter 3, and it still sounded like a pretty good beginning. She's still on the moon, but she's escaping.

Here's what happened in Chapter 1: She's at home with her parents (unlike a lot of YA novels, I wanted to show that she has a good relationship with them, they're alive, and they love each other. Yes, they go missing, but they don't die. They also set the scene by talking about their mission and the current status of the colony (low on water/resources)). 

She goes to school (sets the scene, shows the dome of the lunar colony, establishes ""utopia""). She has an encounter with her obnoxious ex (the son of the corrupt ""Commander"" of the colony). She gets pulled out of class and is notified that her parents' shuttle disappeared while on a mission to scout an asteroid as a potential ice mine. Her friend Stella's parents were also on the mission, but they told her they might not be coming back. Stella thinks there's more to the story, so the two girls form a plan to find out what happened, using Madi's ex as leverage. Meanwhile, Stella will check in their parent's research lab for any evidence.

Chapter 2: Madi pretends to go along with her ex's advances in order to gain access to his dad's office. He takes her home for ""dinner."" At some point, Madi sneaks off to investigate. She finds what she needs (a message from her dad that they're on Earth, and coordinates), and gets a message from Stella about an experimental ship their parents were working on... but when she returns to the meal, Stella is there. She was captured, and they know everything. Stella attacks the Commander, giving Madi time to escape. 

In the third Chapter, Madi takes the tunnels through the colony, sees a bunch of fucked up shit that's happening below the surface (dystopia), finds the spaceship, and narrowly escapes with some damage to her ship. 

Without the first two chapters, it's slightly more confusing but kinda works given that it's fast-paced. I could add in a few lines throughout the next couple chapters to reference key points if necessary. I would be sacrificing A LOT (10,000 words). I do LOVE the lunar colony, getting to describe it, her classes, her home, her parents, etc. Stuff does happen (so it's not *just* setting the scene) and I don't dump a lot of info at once. 

I've always heard to start the book as close to the action as possible. Cutting out those two chapters definitely did that. It does definitely leave the reader asking a lot more questions, which is also a good thing, right? 

I know it's hard to answer this type of question without knowing the whole story, but any advice is welcome. Thanks!

Second TL;DR: I cut out the first to chapters of my book to rewrite them, but the book works without them. Should I leave it? Basically, is it better to set the scene or just start right in the action and set the scene as the story progresses? Additional comments about my story ideas are, of course, welcome. :-)","I deleted my first two chapters to rewrite them, but something weird happened."

I've scoured the Internet in search of options, but no adequate alternatives have presented themselves.

As you may or may not be aware, Reddit has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes to make the site more streamlined and user-accessible, particularly when it comes to how content is offered to subscribers. In keeping with that, they've been tinkering with a new video-uploading service, which /r/GIFs is rolling out.

With this new feature, users can:

\- Upload videos (MP4 or MOV, up to 15 minutes long) directly to Reddit    
\- Convert uploaded videos to GIFs    
\- Trim uploaded videos from within the mobile applications    
\- Read comments while watching Reddit-hosted videos

As with any innovation, there are likely to be some minor bugs to work out, but we'll be working directly with the administrators to make sure that everything functions as it should. Also, please keep in mind that the specific rules of /r/GIFs – particularly those pertaining to length, audio, and originality – will still apply. If you see any rule-breaking submissions, please don't hesitate to let us know.

If you have any trouble with this new service, please make sure that you have the ""Make GIF"" option enabled. Other than that, feel free to ask any questions, and keep those GIFs coming!",Introducing Reddit's Video-to-GIF Mechanic

Upon arrival at the very top, they find a natural monolith of sorts, and are greeted by a booming voice.

""Greetings, travelers!"" the voice says. ""I am the Rock of Wonders! For your efforts in ascending to this height, I shall transform you into anything you desire! Simply throw yourself from the cliff and call out what you wish to be!""

The first of the men – easily the dumbest of the three – shows absolutely no hesitance as he rushes forward, flings himself out into the open air, and shouts ""A dragon!""

There is a flash of light, and a giant, winged serpent comes flying back up. ""It works!"" he says. ""Come on, try it!""

The second of the men thinks for a moment, then rushes forward. Upon leaping from the cliff's edge, he yells ""A billionaire!"" There is another flash of light, and the man's landing is cushioned by an enormous pile of cash.

Several hours pass as the third man contemplates his situation. The sun starts to set as he makes lists of animals and abstract concepts, weighing the pros and cons of each. He considers how his life might change, and what his future might hold. Eventually, he takes to pacing along the cliff's edge, trying to imagine what he'll say when he finally jumps... but in the dim light, he misjudges a step, and slips.

An easy semifinal win against a sporting opponent. All to come up against the most massive of douches in the final, should have quit at the loading screen when I saw attribute cards on Robben, KDB, Vidal, Gotze, etc. But no, I'm competitive. I go 2-0 up, continue to play the game. My opponent sprint dribbles around with Robben and finally finds space to get a shot off, deflects off my CB into the net. A few minutes later KDB gets tackled but managed to take a longshot mid-stumble. MID-STUMBLE. Goes in. Then a carbon copy of the first Robben goal and I'm behind.    


He starts doing what you'd expect after going up in a final. Still, I press... my team have just enough in the tank to get the equalizer, and from then on it's all me but this time his keeper's in my way.    


93rd minute, I get hit on the counter, I shepherd him to the touchline where he puts in a cross, which I clear assuredly. But, what's this? The game stops and the referee points to the spot, the player who crossed the ball in got taken out in the aftermath! I dive the wrong way, it's 4-3 and *this* is where the true agony begins. My players can't run anymore and my opponent decides to stay in his own half. All out attack, high pressure, second man pressing, GK rushing, nothing. My opponent isn't passing it around, he's sprinting backwards and around the back with his juiced up, attribute-bearing players and mine just can't keep up with that. Worst cunt of an opponent I've ever had to play in all my years of FIFA, and I have no intention of increasing the possibility of this happening to me again.

-Apple, 2017

That said, from what I can tell, a brand new, healthy battery should be at 4.2v on the iPhone 6S, at least. (please tell me what your fully charged voltage is on your batteries so I can include other models, but I *think* they are all 4.2v.) The lowest so far I’ve gotten on my brand new battery, with no down clocking, is 3.5v. So assuming the normal operating voltages are 3.5 to 4.2, anything lower will cause downclocking.

The clock speeds for the iPhone 6 are 600MHz, 839MHz, 1127MHz, and 1400MHz.

The clock speeds for the iPhone 6s/(SE?) are 600MHz, 800MHz, 911MHz, 1200Mhz, 1515MHz, and 1848Mhz.

The clock speeds for the iPhone 7 are (unknown) and 2350MHz.

(The above clocks are from reports in the comments of my original post, taken using CPUdasher X)

Now as to why this is needed in the first place, as I have not heard of any android phone or otherwise that has ever had this problem. The iPhone 5S and below are also unaffected.

The iPhone 5S is always clocked at 1.3GHz, resulting in a score of 1268/2139 (via Geekbench) and are not too different from my iPhone 6s at 911MHz, with a score of 1465/2490.

My theory is that the iPhone 6 and up were simply designed as too power hungry to work on lower voltages steadily. You might remember that at the time they came out, iPhones (single core scores anyway) have been higher than any other Android phone on the market, while Android phones usually had higher multi core scores due to having more cores. Perhaps it draws less power to use multiple cores than it does to use a few strong cores at once? Something else I’ve noticed with the Android devices I’ve owned, is as the battery gets older, it doesn’t just shut off, it usually just drains the battery very quickly instead. Perhaps this is down to how the systems are designed to draw power from the battery? I’m basing these mostly off of the processors, not other things such as screen size, brightness, etc. because the iPhone SE and 5S share the same screen, similar battery, and most of the rest of the internals are the same, and the SE is affected while the 5S is not.

This might make some comments outdated. The original post has been archived to pastebin [here.]( https://pastebin.com/JergYngQ)

First, I’ll start with Apple’s official statement on the matter:

>	Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.

>	Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.

Now let me clear a few things up.

Who does this affect?
iPhone 6, 6S, SE, and 7 users at the moment, but it will likely continue for all future iPhones until further notice. Something to note about the iPhone 7: with the A10 chip, it has low power and high power cores. The low power cores are used 90% of the time, and should stay at full speed, so you won’t notice any slowdown except in intensive programs such as benchmarks, demanding games, video editing, etc.

Am I affected?
Depending on the age of your phone and the amount of battery wear, maybe. You can check this for sure by using an app called CPUdasher X that is no longer free, now being $0.99. You can check this by scrolling down to CPU Frequency. The 6 is supposed to be 1400, the 6S 1848, and the 7 2350. As far as I know, there is NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE to this. You can, however, do a geek bench or Antutu test to tell you what your CPU score is compared to what it should be, but it won’t tell you your clock speed. 

How do I fix this?
You must replace your battery. You can do this in 3 ways:

1.	Do it yourself. You can buy a battery for $10-$20 and follow the guide on iFixit.com to repair your device. This WILL void you warranty, and Apple will not work on your device ever again, meaning all future repairs will have to be done by you. You have been warned.
2.	Take it to a 3rd party location, such as Experimac of Batteries + Bulbs. Anywhere is fine, but make sure they have a warranty, and check Apple’s pricing before you decide on the store. This will also void your warranty with Apple, and they will never repair it again. You have been warned.
3.	Take it to Apple. They charge $79 for all devices, and you can take it into an Apple store with another 1 year warranty after you leave.

I’m replacing my battery myself. How do I know what battery to buy?
Don’t EVER buy an unbranded battery. If it’s generic, it’s likely to be very low quality, and might not even fix the problem. If it has a name brand, it’s probably fine. I will keep a list of brands that work here and will update it whenever someone else lists that brand.

>Mobile Defenders

>iFixit

As for WHY this happens, you can speculate with me here on [this post.](https://reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7l9zen/discussion_for_why_apple_slows_down_iphones_with/)

If you are affected, I ask that you report your device model, Geekbench scores, battery voltage, and CPU clock speed if you can. It will help paint a clearer picture for the future.

2. On the 10th second, it makes a single beep as the light turns off
3. It beeps every 5 seconds, and the light comes on each time it beeps, only for the duration of the beep

However, it has also:

1. Lit up for 2 seconds
2. Flashed 5 times after that first light
3. On the fifth flash, it makes a beep and the light goes out, followed by the same single beep and flash every 5 seconds

This is with an 85 Watt power supply and a battery. This problem occurs with just one or the other, or both. I'm leaning towards a logic board failure, but I've never seen new ram NOT fix the beeping every 5 seconds before, so I'm curious if anyone else has had this error and what you've tried

I didn’t know where else to put this, so I thought I’d give this subreddit a try.  My girlfriend of 1 year and 4 months just broke up tonight. We said we’d get back together if we both decided on it, but something tells me that probably won’t happen. Here’s some backstory:

My girlfriend and I are in High School, me a Senior, her, a Sophomore. For the past few weeks or so, she’s been stressed because we’ve been together for so long, planned out our lives, (it’s long distance but she came down to visit for the first time in August. We’ve never had too much problems with being long distance, but it does complicate things.) and generally have had a good idea on our futures. This stresses her out, because she feels like High School is a very important time to experience so many things and in general find out who you are. She feels like she’s being “trapped” is how she puts it, because she’s with me, and won’t get to experience anyone else. She’s a big people person, (ENFP for anyone who knows, I’m an INTJ) and likes being flirty and fun and in general just a social butterfly. She said she loves me so much, and I love her just as much too, but being with me is stressing her out because she likes to meet new people, learn who they are, etc. and she doesn’t think just being friends is enough, I suppose, (but she said she wasn’t leaving so she could get in a relationship, just wants a break to be “free” and single for a while.) I told her she can come back and I’ll still love her and accept her if she doesn’t find leaving me to be worth it, but until then we aren’t together, and if she finds someone else, then that will be it. We match up together very well, both personality wise and physically, but she’s feeling trapped and stressed and scared, really. (I think I should also mention that I’m pretty sure she has dependent personality disorder, or DPD.) I was the one who proposed we separate and if she wants to come back, she can. Im just wondering now if I made the right choice. I really do want to be with her, but I’d rather her be happy. I feel empty now that she’s gone, and being my first breakup, it’s pretty shocking, considering how much we love each other, and thought we always would. I suppose that didn’t turn out as well as we’d expected though. I just want to know if I made the right choice or what I could do better or differently to make things work out for us, and if not, what I can do to help things move along smoothly.

Fast forward to repairing the software and replacing the laser, and we come to the problem that I've just dealt with for a while now.

I opened it again today deciding to fix it after months of dealing with this.

Now go my current problem: after greasing up the gears, it all runs smoothly, and I can insert a disc form any side. Yay! Unfortunately, and ironically, now it won't eject anything unless I keep spamming eject multiple times. The gears are fine, and the drive has good grip on the disc. (Maybe too good?) it goes in, and the drive is fine otherwise, but just seems too weak to come out. I'll post pics tomorrow with more description of what I think might be the problem (no idea on a solution) but until then, any ideas? Thanks in advance

I know it's a hardware issue btw, software works fine. Been playing MGS4 recently for the first time, which is what prompted me to fix it lol. It's a PS3 Slim, but I don't know the model number. I'll check tomorrow with the pictures posted of the disc drive.

Edit: model number is CHECH-3001

Here are some pictures with descriptions:
https://imgur.com/gallery/FtAOV

It appears as if the second contact point doesn't have enough power to push the disc out, still not sure yet, but the first contact point works fine when finishing the ejection or when pulling the disc in, and only has problems pulling the disc in when it reaches the second contact point

The gears have been checked and are all working fine, no missing teeth, and are responsive, just can't figure out why the second point is so ""weak."" My only current hypothesis is that the grip on the disc is too strong once it's in, making it difficult for the motor to eject the disc. Any thoughts?

Edit 2: It's fixed! Here's some more images http://imgur.com/a/rrN3h

Basically the drive WAS putting too much force on the disc, making it too difficult for it to go in or out. The solution? Take out one of the springs. Because of the design of the Blu-Ray Drive, one side can't move without the other one moving as well, so as long as one has a working spring it will move the other.

* [Link to Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/konohana-kitan)

*tl;dr:* Konohana Kitan lures you in with the promises of yuri fox girls, then delivers on that and more. The show made me audibly “awww” multiple times per episode, while exploring Japanese folklore and the nature of relationships. Comfy, warm, and emotional, Konohana Kitan deserves more viewership.

##Introduction:

As often the case, I found myself starting the Fall 2017 season with too much on my plate. There were too many prospective shows to watch, and too little time to watch them. I had my “for-sures,” and started skimming through my maybes.

I started the first episode of Konohana Kitan as a joke. I was joking with a friend about the fanservicey premise, and planned on turning the episode off at the first hint of some. 

[Instead, I was greeted with an adorable scene featuring an even more adorable Yuzu.](https://my.mixtape.moe/ffqapq.mp4)

This short little scene somehow managed to enthrall me, and I added it to my watching list. And I couldn’t be more grateful.

##Why should you watch it?:

#[Steeped in Culture](https://j-mag.org/en/2017/11/30/konohana_ep9_mythology/)

Konohana Kitan is undeniably Japanese. The main setting is reminiscent of Spirited Away, and retains much of the same charm. Konohanatei exists between life and death, and the show explores many aspects of Japanese culture. One of the characters has dreams of becoming a miko, or shrine maiden, and there were a few things that caused me to dive more into their culture. For example, one of the characters is a reference to an old Japanese ghost story, [Banchō Sarayashiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banch%C5%8D_Sarayashiki). It’s weird because although the series is inherently fantastical, it has a foundation of realism that gives it a unique character.

#Cute Girls doing Responsible Things

What’s interesting to think about, is that Konohana Kitan essentially is a workplace anime. But rather than being like the Shirobakos and Working!!!s of the world, its setting is out of this world… literally. It’s incredibly charming to watch these characters deal with the unique predicaments that their workplace brings, and adds a unique tinge to its atmosphere. It is the essence of what makes anime like these great, watching lovable characters interact with both each other, and the positions they find themselves in.

#Adorable Characters

Speaking of characters, every time [Yuzu is on screen](https://i.imgur.com/3iqzWbY.jpg), I have to stifle a squeal. But the series isn’t that shallow; each character is unique and interact in meaningful ways. Yuzu is a absolute treasure, and her kindness permeates through every fiber of Konohana Kitan… as we watch her spread her purity to the other characters. But Yuzu is far from being the only important character in Konohana Kitan. The show is careful to give each one their own screen time, and allow their own quirks and personalities to blossom. Part of why the series is so enjoyable, like many series, is watching them change over time. Whether that be Satsuki lowering her guard, or Ren being more secure in her relationship with Natsume.

#Surreal Creepy Atmosphere

While the show exudes cuteness from its core, it also is curiously...creepy? Almost every episode had me going “what the hell did I just watch?” in some way, and I think it’s a major benefit of the series. Konohana Kitan isn’t afraid to ask deep questions, and challenge the audience’s expectations. What else would you call having an episode where an [egg attaches to people](https://puu.sh/y6O8N/a0ad15529f.jpg) as a [form of pregnancy](https://i.imgur.com/233yfbC.png)? Watching an episode almost feels like you’re in a dream.

What I’m trying to get at, is that Konohana Kitan blends fluffiness with introspectiveness, and does so fantastically. It’s one of the main tenets of iyashikei that it exhibits to a T, the evocation of emotion. To me, a series is truly great if it can summon tears just as much as it can draw out laughter, and I can say Konohana Kitan fits this criteria.

#Miscellaneous

While it doesn’t ever go “all the way,” (or does it) there definitely is yuri in this show. And it escapes the feeling of being forced or being pure fanservice. The relationships between the girls are heartwarming and inviting, and are treated like actual people connecting with one another, rather than some author’s fantasy.

The show is also really funny! I found myself laughing a lot, and it does the Shokugeki and FMA: Brotherhood thing where the characters transform into [adorable chibi versions of themselves](https://i.imgur.com/vonymR4.jpg); sometimes to the point where they’re just [vaguely fox shaped blobs](https://imgur.com/mpWDXuV). Konohana oozes with character driven comedy, with even minor characters (like Okiku) given time to assert themselves and their personalities.

##Conclusion:

Konohana Kitan is utterly charming, and is so in a way that feels like a breath of fresh air. I came into it expecting fanservice laden shots of naked fox girls, but the only thing this show bared… was its soul. In doing so, it made me reflect on my own as a result. I can’t recommend this show enough, and hope I was able to articulate exactly why in my post. The only flaw Konohana Kitan has that I can think of… is that it ends.

* [Link to MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34012/Isekai_Shokudou)
* [Link to Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/restaurant-to-another-world)

*tl;dr:* Restaurant to Another World makes my mouth water. I kind of think of it as “Shokugeki without the hype,” which might seem like an insult, but I mean it as nothing but praise. It’s wonderfully animated, utterly fantastic (in every meaning of the word), and relaxing. It is satisfaction incarnate.

#Introduction:

First of all, [some mood music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9byBFxubzeo)

Week after week, I found myself looking more and more forward to Isekai Shokudou, despite the hype and high-action shows airing alongside it. I find that it takes a really unique take on the “isekai” genre, and it explores a world with pretty much endless possibilities. Every episode puts a giant grin on my face, makes my stomach grumble, and made Monday’s just a touch more bearable.

*What is Restaurant to Another World?*

Restaurant to Another World is an isekai/another world show where **we** are the other world. Instead of a confused otaku teen being transported, the fantasy characters come to you! This results in a ton of unique backstories of different characters. Every 7 days, a mysterious door appears in different worlds, leading to Western Restaurant Nekoya. Normal restaurant by day, and restaurant to travelers across space and time by night, the anime focuses on these other-worlders and their experiences with all sorts of cuisine.

Why should you watch it?

##Alluring Atmosphere

They say iyashikei are a form of escapism. Isekai Shokudou does a great job of drawing you into its world. Just to illustrate, the show contains dwarves, elves, half-elves, knights, princesses, ninjas, magicians, adventurers, merpeople, lizard people, and so on and so on. Each episode segment  focuses on the personal stories of these  characters, and there’s so much context that the world feels very much alive. And the variety presented doesn’t in anyway dilute their individual stories, each episode is packed with worldbuilding and lore, to the point where I feel fundamentally connected to the characters.

And the music is just sublime. A piano/orchestral backbeat encompasses every scene, and it manages to be extremely relaxing and cheery without feeling sleepy or dreary.

##Reactions to Delicious Meals

The food looks absolutely incredible. And judging from the [reactions](https://i.imgur.com/KZ0dWQI.png) [of the people](https://i.imgur.com/avkCjhy.png) [eating it](https://i.imgur.com/P437tSH.png), tastes incredible too. Once again, being so connected to the characters, I can’t help but feel extremely happy (and envious), of them finally getting to eat good food after all of their hardships. All of the characters have their own signature dish that they order constantly, and this results in hilarious arguments as they argue with one another about which is best. I can’t help but be reminded of the infamous food orgasms from Shokugeki no Souma, but these are more grounded and down-to-earth. Instead of guffawing, instead a warm relaxing happiness springs forth and only continues to grow as the show goes on. I find that, even though these characters are pure fantasy and literally out of this world, the show makes them incredibly relatable. Who hasn’t argued with their friends what the best kind food was?


#Conclusion:

Restaurant to Another World is an utterly relaxing experience, filled with whimsy and gorgeous shots of food. With it’s vast cast of characters, adorableness, and immense worldbuilding, it never fails to make me smile. [Also, just look at this food…](https://imgur.com/a/QtbVE) 

###You may like Isekai Shokudou if you liked…

[Shokugeki no Souma](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28171/Shokugeki_no_Souma?q=shoku) - Isekai Shokudou isn’t anything close to a shounen, but if you like shots of food and people reacting to eating it, you’ll like this.

[Amamma to Inazuma \(Sweetness and Lightning\)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32828/Amaama_to_Inazuma) - While Sweetness and Lightning used the food-making as a bonding experience, Isekai Shokudou carries the relaxing air while adding a touch of fantasy.

[Flying Witch](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31376/Flying_Witch?q=flying%20witch) - Like Flying Witch, Isekai Shokudou combines fantastical elements with a sleepy comfy atmosphere to great effect. Restaurant to Another World feels a bit more disjointed than Flying Witch due to its focus on introducing as many characters as possible, but it’s a good substitute if you just want to feel a bit more happy after a stressful day.

/u/PPGN_DM_Exia wrote a great WT! for this that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5o90x6/wt_pocos_udon_world/). I feel like I had some more things to add, and this show deserves all the promotion it can get.

**tl;dr**: Poco’s Udon World deals with simultaneously affirming your past while also letting it go. That is, reliving your memories and all the emotions that entails, and moving forward as a better person because of it. Udon World is an [iyashikei](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei) through and through, with hints of Usagi Drop and Barakamon emanating from its core. Cathartic, relatable, and relaxing; Poco’s Udon World drags you through sentimental feelings into a tranquil peace. 

#Introduction:

Past. The word has a connotation that varies from one person to another; and likewise evokes a deluge of emotions that range from joyfulness to full on cringe. How we deal with our past is also something that each person has their own modus operandi for. Some people may choose to forget about it all-together, instead forging onward to the future.

Poco’s Udon World tries to show us that that isn’t the way to go. Instead, it advocates that we accept the existence of our pasts, both our achievements and our regrets, and incorporate them into our very being. Because, isn’t that what we are in the first place? A culmination of our past feelings, experiences, and responses to those experiences?

#What is Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari?

Poco’s Udon World follows Souta Tawara, a web designer that unfortunately must return to his hometown in Kagawa prefecture after his father’s passing. While cleaning up his dad’s old udon restaurant, he discovers a peculiar boy sleeping only to find out that he’s not really a boy at all. Souta decides to take care of Poco anyway, and can’t help but relive his past as he discovers the joys of raising a child.

#Why should you watch it?

I think Poco’s Udon World addresses an important question: how important is nostalgia? And the answer it comes up with is: pretty important. But Udon World isn’t about how you should regret the past. Historically, the feeling of nostalgia was looked down upon; the thinking being that you were ill if you wanted to live in the past rather than the present. But psychologists today say that nostalgia is an incredibly good thing to experience, and gives us a sense of continuity and progress. 

We join Souta at a time where he can’t help but reminiscence and ask, “did I make the right decision? Am I making the right decision?” In fact, almost every character in Udon World asks these questions, and Udon World does a great job at exploring their feelings as they communicate to one another in an attempt to answer them. In an iyashikei, the story is crafted through its characters. And the characters in Udon World are used masterfully in promoting its themes.

Udon World is peppered with flashbacks as Souta relives his memories; some good, some bad.  He can’t help but find similarities in how his dad raised him, and how he finds himself raising Poco. And through this, Souta is able to find a connection with his father, even after he’s passed. This leads to some tender, tearful moments that Udon World does extremely well. Udon World recognizes that sometimes there are treasured memories that we happen to forget, and by looking back on the past we find renewed purpose in the present. This message is shared by the whole cast, not just Souta.

Spliced in-between reminiscence of bittersweet memories are the crazy antics only a rowdy toddler could provide. Pair that with that toddler being a mischievous tanuki spirit, and you get amusing pinches Souta finds himself in all too often. Udon World provides just the right amount of comedy to lighten up its sentimental scenes.

Plus, Poco is just too [god](http://i.imgur.com/7BeEGJw.jpg)-[damn](http://i.imgur.com/Nef1g9I.jpg) [adorable](http://i.imgur.com/xQT6YAr.jpg), and that should be a reason to watch it in and of itself.

#Introduction

“It’s been a long day.” I’m sure every person has uttered this phrase at least once; usually accompanied by an exasperated sigh or a meager attempt at a reassuring smile. In Japan especially, the culture surrounding their work environment often results in exhausted and stressed salarymen returning home just to repeat the process a few hours later. It is no wonder then; that media has sprung up with the sole purpose of allowing its viewers to finally *relax*.

Iyashikei (癒し系) is the Japanese word for healing, and has come to represent a genre that is based on doing just that. If we can imagine all of life’s inconveniences, frustrations, and hardships as chipping at one’s soul throughout an infamous “long day;” iyashikei shows seek to nurse it back to health, leaving one relaxed and refreshed. Iyashikei is believed to have split off from the slice-of-life genre, but over time has since embraced its own identity. It still shares many of the same qualities, but executes them in its own unique way in pursuit of its goal. Anime is known for fantasticality; as it offers the ability to explore [worlds](http://i.imgur.com/NqmrY8s.jpg) and [themes](http://i.imgur.com/CdtruZF.png) in a way that live-action media can only hope to aspire to. It is due to this that I find it amusing to witness a sub-genre that is focused on being as [subdued](http://i.imgur.com/GEPnP0v.jpg) and [down-to-earth](http://img1.animescreencaps.com/galleries/Non_Non_Biyori-Repeat/ep07/Non_Non_Biyori-Repeat_Screenshot_0038.jpg) as possible. Regardless, it only takes one viewing to see that the experience that iyashikei provides rivals even the most action-packed or drama-filled show.

Throughout this essay, I would like to explore and answer two main questions:

1.    What are the common elements of an iyashikei show?
2.     How do those elements accomplish iyashikei’s ultimate goal of relaxation?

Non Non Biyori, Flying Witch, and Hidamari Sketch are often considered model shows for the iyashikei genre. A quick perusal of online forums reveals countless comments on their healing properties, and one can almost feel the [calmness and happiness emanating from the screen](http://i.imgur.com/bbUX0rc.png) as users rave about these not-so-hidden gems that they’ve found. And as one watches these shows, a few shared aspects unique to iyashikei come to light. *Iyashikei shows endeavor to relieve their audience’s stress, and do so using crafted visuals, invocation of emotion, and expert use of its own unique style of comedy.* Let’s explore these three shows that many consider to be epitomes of the iyashikei genre, and how they go about making their viewers as “comfy” as possible.

#Crafted visuals

##Use of nature

What we see has great influence on what we feel. Iyashikei not only owns this fact, but uses it to its utmost advantage. For example, both Flying Witch and Non Non Biyori take place away from dense urban environments and [embrace a rural aesthetic](http://i.imgur.com/79cQ3px.jpg). [Gorgeous backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/RMa4HDI.jpg) [run abound](http://i.imgur.com/dx5v1sY.jpg) throughout each of the series, with many locations [taking inspiration](http://imgur.com/a/a30SK) from [real-life places](https://youtu.be/9_Oe18P_RXM). Nature has been known to improve [mood and concentration](http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/calming-power-nature/), as well as [recharge one with both physical and mental energy](https://dirt.asla.org/2011/09/08/research-shows-nature-helps-with-stress/); making it a no-brainer for iyashikei settings. Research has brought forth evidence that exposure to nature, even only visually, rests our brains. The mechanism is still being studied, but Dr. Marc Berman, assistant professor at the University of Chicago, posits that the phenomenon may be due to something he calls “involuntary attention.” Simply put, when in nature one is able to let his or her mind wander free and “take in” the environment around them, instead of having to focus on one thing or another. And looking at the meticulous backgrounds in [Flying Witch](http://i.imgur.com/ditkk7r.jpg) and [Non Non Biyori](http://i.imgur.com/R7yvwBg.jpg), there’s certainly a lot to look at.

##Alternatives

But nature isn’t the be-all end-all when it comes to iyashikei. Plenty of shows in the genre do not utilize a natural aesthetic or focus on country-life, but still manage to evoke involuntary attention. Our third model iyashikei show, Hidamari Sketch, is a prime example. Although there isn’t much depiction of nature, its art-style is still able to convey a sense of rest and relaxation. If we revisit involuntary attention, we can see it’s akin to unfocused attention, being able to look at something without needing to fully examine or study it (and work an already overworked brain). In Hidamari Sketch, the backgrounds are [quite simple](https://i.imgur.com/Q2V74Ga.png), and at times [become](https://i.imgur.com/f6fdNkr.png) [even simpler](https://i.imgur.com/329DXJV.png), allowing one to take in the antics as they play out. At the same time, the series feels surreal and dreamlike in its visuals, thanks to studio Shaft. One of the visual tricks that Hidamari Sketch uses is the use of [real life items](https://i.imgur.com/xrZtcga.png) throughout the series. At first it might provide a shock, but later perhaps inspires a sense of familiarity as we [watch the characters use](https://i.imgur.com/4JTE1iw.png) ([and](https://imgur.com/wPmOIch.png) [eat](https://i.imgur.com/xNjzqvH.png)) items that we might see in our daily lives. Other ways that Shaft instills a calm disposition includes the series’ use of [shot](https://i.imgur.com/1fyV1iY.png) [compositions](https://i.imgur.com/yztppUU.png), [scene transitions/cutaways](https://sakugabooru.com/data/f1b69f100905992fb509f8359022e554.webm), and [choice](https://i.imgur.com/eMKPn0K.png) [of](https://i.imgur.com/5GV6F9w.png) [backgrounds](https://i.imgur.com/x1TQJAA.png); adding to its unique charm. Finally, the [palette of the series](http://i.imgur.com/Py30j7m.png) lends itself to relaxation. Colors tend to be more washed out and subdued in comparison to other series.[ It has been reported that colors may impact mood, with the release of neurotransmitters throughout the brain being a possible explanation.](http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/science/color-has-a-powerful-effect-on-behavior-researchers-assert.html?pagewanted=all) [In a study done by the University of Alberta](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1984-16326-001), changing the prominent colors in a classroom from orange to blue both lowered blood pressure and aggression in private school students. Hidamari Sketch isn’t alone in this, Flying Witch and Non Non Biyori also celebrate the greens, blues, and browns of nature. But visuals can only do so much to destress.

#Invocation of emotion

##Sentimentality

Some of the most healing moments in iyashikei are the most emotional. Although it seems counterproductive, sadness and sentimentality work quite a deal to improve our mood. Emotional scenes allow us to connect with the characters. A number of these moments exist in Non Non Biyori, but sentimentality is most apparent in episode 3 (“I Ran Away From Home With My Sister”) and episode 4 (“Summer Vacation Started”). In episode 3, Natsumi has an [argument](https://i.imgur.com/CVQrk5z.png) with her mother and [runs away](https://i.imgur.com/5PO3WgH.png), dragging Komari with her. Once they reach their secret hideout however, they begin to reminisce about days past and realize that their mother [truly](https://i.imgur.com/9MGMsOy.png) [loves](https://i.imgur.com/UH2bBm8.png) [them](https://i.imgur.com/2KruP6N.png) and is only trying to look out for their best interests. This message is driven home with the parallel of a stray cat, who at first [seems ornery](https://i.imgur.com/SV7EHDT.png), but is only [caring](https://i.imgur.com/fGeBpUa.png) [for her kittens](https://i.imgur.com/vxvSN3H.png). [They return home not to an angry mother](https://streamable.com/zv7n9), [but a hot dinner](https://i.imgur.com/2FnqT3h.png). This episode is extremely relatable; who hasn’t had an argument or two with their parents? By inspiring a sense of nostalgia and parental nurturing, this episode of Non Non Biyori is able to have the viewer think back to their own experience, and relive days where you still had someone to worry about you, scold you, and treat you to a hot meal. [Nostalgia has been shown to alleviate feelings of loneliness, boredom, and anxiety.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/science/what-is-nostalgia-good-for-quite-a-bit-research-shows.html?pagewanted=all&) The act of looking back on the past provides us with a sense of continuity and progress, and makes us feel more secure in ourselves as a result. In addition to nostalgia, an important concept in Japanese culture is amae. Amae (甘え) is difficult to translate into english, but it involves the desire to be cared by or be dependent on another person. The late psychoanalyst Takeo Doi, and author of “[The anatomy of dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anatomy_of_Dependence)”, describes it as “a uniquely Japanese need to be in good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself.” The easiest example would be the feeling of having your parents to rely on when you’re a child, a kind-of safety net. Episode 3 of Non Non Biyori invokes amae in the viewer, triggering nostalgia and its effects.


[Mono no aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware) (物の哀れ) is a Japanese term calling for the awareness of impermanence. Japan often celebrates the concept of impermanence, with [wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi) (侘寂) also existing as a concept in Japanese aesthetics. Iyashikei welcome the idea wholeheartedly, resulting in a slower pace and bittersweet episodes. Once again, Non Non Biyori exudes relatability while also capturing the idea of mono no aware in episode 4, “Summer Vacation Started.” Renge quickly makes a new friend as kids often do, but is wracked with sadness when they must be suddenly separated. [The resulting scene is poetry.](https://streamable.com/5cu1i) While Renge’s tears might in turn make us misty-eyed, ultimately it improves both of our moods. Crying and iyashikei in general invoke catharsis. In addition to being able to express pent-up emotions, [catharsis also alters levels of different chemicals in the body](https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/06/06/7-good-reasons-to-cry-your-eyes-out/), [decreasing stress and improving mood.](https://answersingenesis.org/human-body/the-miracle-of-tears/) [The act of empathizing](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_fight_stress_with_empathy) as well causes the release of oxytocin, the “love hormone,”  which leads us to be less irritable and more understanding.

##Warm feelings


Of course if melancholy can serve to improve mood, certainly happier emotions would suffice as well. Flying Witch takes a different route in relaxing its viewer, but is not diminished for doing so in the least. Instead of using mono no aware and nostalgia, Flying Witch substitutes in whimsy and awe. Although the main character of the series is the [lovable apprentice-witch Makoto](https://i.imgur.com/xY8uaiu.jpg), the series truly shines by looking through the eyes of [Chinatsu, her adorable cousin](http://i.imgur.com/lVxcv2m.jpg). By being unfamiliar with the magical world, Chinatsu is able to instill childlike wonder in the audience through the use of her own. [Her curiosity](http://i.imgur.com/tM6uiBM.png) is almost insatiable, which is no surprise considering the [awe-inspiring](https://imgur.com/sniZjSV.jpg) [events](http://i.imgur.com/6E1ygCr.jpg) that she finds herself experiencing on the regular. What Chinatsu also evokes is a sense of instructional and parental instinct.
Oxytocin was briefly mentioned above, and while it is released during bouts of empathy, it plays a larger role in social bonding and parental nurturing. When we act “parent-like”, or witness acts of parenting, our levels of oxytocin increase and subsequently affect our mood. It is no coincidence that many iyashikei have themes of family and parental care. A much beloved episode of Non Non Biyori involves the relationship between [Ren-chon and Dagashi](http://imgur.com/eeS9ZL9.jpg), as we discover that Kaede is very much like a [second mom](http://imgur.com/ScNRvNN.jpg) to Renge (“We Watched the First Sunrise of the Year”). Themes of family and care are also apparent in Hidamari Sketch, with everyone coming together to [care for](https://i.imgur.com/E4r8GmS.png) [a sick](https://i.imgur.com/WGmD280.png) [Yuno](https://i.imgur.com/SmphJ6y.png), and Sae contending with [her emotions about her sister’s visit](http://i.imgur.com/0ma2pn2.png). 


Lastly, I want to briefly touch on “kawaii” and “moe.”  Kawaii is often translated as “cute,” but the term is more expansive than we typically think of the concept. Kawaii is made up of two components, physicality and emotiveness. In Noble prize-winner Dr. Konrad Lorenz’s 1943 paper on [Kindchenschema \(baby schema\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260535/), he outlines common physical characteristics of things that we might call cute: “[fat cheeks](http://i.imgur.com/N06Gpti.jpg), [large eyes](https://i.imgur.com/eVLybYZ.png) set low on the face, a high forehead, [a small nose and jaw](https://imgur.com/jczKO5x.png), and [stubby arms and legs that might move in a clumsy fashion](http://i.imgur.com/Kmq1hxS.png).” In the study, these characteristics are applied to more than humans, with Lorenz studying puppies, ducks, and other young animals as well. It’s not a large leap to make that anime may have co-opted these basic characteristics of cuteness for their own use ([and it seems while doing so they’ve stumbled upon extremely wide heads to add to the list](https://i.imgur.com/0LRLpY2.png)). [In addition to oxytocin, viewing cute things also seems to release dopamine, another mood enhancer and the “reward” hormone.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/kumamon-the-new-science-of-cute) Knowing this explains a lot of why Hidamari Sketch does so much to make the viewer feel happy and at ease; kawaii and cuteness absolutely permeate the series from its core. But, to completely attribute the series’ healing properties to its cute visuals would be a huge oversight, because you’d be overlooking the component of emotiveness. 


Emotiveness simply means pertaining to emotion, and I use it to address the feelings that arise when consuming “kawaii” content. [Moe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_\(slang\)) (萌え) is Japanese slang that is derived from the word that means “to sprout or bloom.” The exact definition of moe has changed over time, and the meaning of the word is [hotly debated today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQYon3fbgDQ). Dr. Patrick W. Galbraith, and author of “[The Moe Manifesto](https://smile.amazon.com/Moe-Manifesto-Insiders-Worlds-Gaming/dp/4805312823?sa-no-redirect=1),” proposed a definition in the aforementioned manifesto. “In this contemporary usage, moe means an *affectionate response to fictional characters*….First moe is a response, a verb, something that is done. Second, as a response, moe is situated in those responding to a character, not the character itself. Third, the response is triggered by fictional characters. [emphasis mine]” For the purposes of this essay I will use this definition. Some iyashikei shows intend to elicit moe in their audience as a method to relieve their stress. Hidamari Sketch does this throughout the series by giving the audience someone to root for...Yuno. Throughout the series we see Yuno struggle with multiple things: her art, living alone for the first time, and sickness. As we watch her overcome her obstacles, I believe that a feeling of moe arises, a sort-of desire to support and protect her. But this feeling doesn’t just arise throughout her hardships, viewers may moe at how [her and her friends have fun and go about their days](http://i.imgur.com/CuC4PRn.png), and hope that she is able to hold on to those times. The above-mentioned effects of cute things come about not only when *viewing* kawaii content, but also when one feels a moe response. Dr. Christine Yano at the University of Hawaii at Manoa asserts that “...filling an emotional need is exactly where kawaii(sic) plays a significant role.” And journalist Nicholas Kristof comments that “...when a society needs to heal, it seeks comfort in the familiar. And often the familiar may reside in ‘cute’.”

#Expert use of it’s own unique style of comedy

##Comedic techniques

Iyashikei often aims to elicit a slight smile or chuckle, rather than roaring laughter. A lot of the techniques used in the comedy of iyashikei shows would not be out of place in a guide to stand-up. However, these techniques are slightly manipulated to better suit the desired outcome of relaxation.  For example, although timing is an important element of comedy as a whole, it is paramount in an iyashikei. In something like KonoSuba, the jokes and ridiculousness [come rapid-fire](https://streamable.com/w5vzc), resulting in side-splitting laughter. In an iyashikei, much like the genre as a whole, comedy is crafted to be more subdued. One might say that in a more traditional comedy anime you have high peaks among a middling baseline, while iyashikei anime seek to keep that baseline at a constant high. You probably won’t find it as funny or laugh as hard, but that’s not what an iyashikei is trying to do. Instead, it wishes to keep you in an elevated mood constantly throughout the episode ([for max comfy](http://i.imgur.com/vmR7gPm.png)). 

So, iyashikei is content to do things like delay punchlines. In episode 2 of Flying Witch (“A Visitor for the Witch”), Makoto has a dream about Nao and indicates that [good luck may be in her future](http://i.imgur.com/Daurhq3.jpg). It’s a small comment within the scheme of the whole episode, but later the viewer is treated to a amusing after-credits scene of [Nao waiting eagerly for her lucky moment to occur](https://streamable.com/wr9by). By establishing the setup well before the punchline, the show is able to end the episode on a light-hearted note. More importantly, it also is able to appeal to two different kinds of people: the ones who remembered and the ones who forgot. For the ones that remember the setup, it creates a sense of anticipation which leads into the inevitable payoff; and the ones that forgot are treated to an unexpected surprise which results in a bigger laugh. Iyashikei have the luxury of giving their jokes time to breathe. This concept is used in Hidamari Sketch as well. In the first episode (“January 11: Winter Collage) Miyako characteristically [messes up writing “Love and Peace”](http://i.imgur.com/X4WmTrN.png) in the snow, [writing “Love and Piece” instead](http://i.imgur.com/bCVjth4.png). The screw-up is funny in and of itself, but the hilarity is multiplied further when [her friends later call her out on it](http://i.imgur.com/vO4HpKr.png), and she [provides](http://i.imgur.com/17K3CLk.png) [a](http://i.imgur.com/QctMCkL.png) [truly](http://i.imgur.com/kSjEgh4.png) [lackluster](http://i.imgur.com/EmfxuF6.png) [explanation.](http://i.imgur.com/999eNmC.png) In comedy, this trick is referred to as a callback, and is believed to create audience rapport. When the punchline is delivered, the enjoyment is greater because the audience feels as if they are “in” on the joke.

##Character-driven comedy


But, while these tweaks of comedic techniques are the foundation of comedy in an iyashikei, what it really comes down to is the characters. Iyashikei tend to be extremely character-driven, both in terms of the plot (however little there may be) and its comedy. Adam Sternbergh, culture editor for the New York Times Magazine, [attempted to create a distinction between character-driven comedy and what he calls “joke-driven” comedy.](https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/there-is-no-sheep-at-the-table-what-exactly-is-a-jokeless-comedy/?_r=0) “In character-driven comedies, funny people say funny things and fall into funny situations, but it’s all contained in the realm of plausible realism; nothing absurd or unbelievable occurs. Joke-driven comedies, by contrast, start with the absurd and unbelievable and go from there.” Sternbergh is referring to big budget films with this statement, but I believe that it in part still holds true for anime. Much of the amusement derived from iyashikei shows arise through characters with distinct personalities interacting with one another and responding to situations they find themselves in. Compare this to a series like [Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10357/Jinrui_wa_Suitai_Shimashita?q=humanity) (Humanity Has Declined), whose first episode includes a [loaf of bread committing suicide](http://i.imgur.com/7bnw5VQ.png) by [ripping itself in half.](http://i.imgur.com/olWKn49.png) Character-driven comedy exists in spades throughout all three of our model iyashikei shows. Flying Witch wouldn’t be the same without the kind but blundering Makoto, or the ever curious Chinatsu and her adorable antics. The same goes for Non Non Biyori and [Hotaru’s almost-obsession](http://i.imgur.com/68z4obH.png) and [Komari’s want](http://i.imgur.com/KkgB0LR.png) [to impress](http://i.imgur.com/CJpjhhb.png). However, out of the three, Hidamari Sketch is able to craft character-driven comedy the most intricately. 


Each of the members of the 4-person main cast are multifaceted and play off of each other well. It’s hard to explain; but it’s the sort of laugh that comes about when you watch a scene play out, and a character [does exactly what you’d expect them to do](https://streamable.com/ehsxd). If you were to compare it to western media, it would be what gives Charlie from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia his charm, or the Todd from Scrubs. The character itself becomes a running gag. In essence, it’s similar to how we might make our own friends laugh in our everyday lives, but to an exaggerated degree. As for how comedy affects our mood, the answer is obvious; very rarely are laughing people also stressed and depressed people. [But science supports this observation as well](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199607/happily-ever-laughter), laughter lowers blood pressure and heart rate, putting us into a relaxed state. Endorphins are also released shortly after laughter, your body’s natural analgesics, literally alleviating any pain you might harbor.  It is no wonder then, why iyashikei and comedy go hand in hand.

#Conclusion

What are the common elements of an iyashikei show? How do these elements accomplish iyashikei’s ultimate goal of relaxation? These are the two questions I sought to provide answers for, and through the study of three staple iyashikei I believe that we have arrived at providing suitable ones. Iyashikei contain visuals that evoke “involuntary attention,” through the use of nature or other means. Involuntary attention rests our brains, allowing one to recharge and relax. At the same time, visuals may depict cuteness or “kawaii”, instilling new emotions in the viewer such as moe, and activating different chemical pathways that ultimately lead to a more relaxed audience. Along with the happy comes with the sad, with nostalgia and sentimentality being a large part of some iyashikei. Mono no aware adds a solemn note to many series and emphasizes the passage of time and impermanence of things. Ultimately, all of these boil down to wanting to invoke emotion, happy or sad, as a method to leave the audience less stressed in the end. While some series focus on a more melancholy and introspective look at things, many choose to fill the room with laughter instead. This is done in a manner unique to iyashikei, focusing on interactions between characters rather than absurd situations. 

##Broader application

Using this as a criteria for what makes an iyashikei, we can expand beyond the three shows that we studied and apply these principles more broadly. For example, is [Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32093/Tanaka-kun_wa_Itsumo_Kedaruge) (Tanaka-kun is Always Listless) an iyashikei? Well, despite being mainly set in a school, the [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/ZvQuDbj.png) [are](http://i.imgur.com/1DrHpEX.png) [beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/Yx88DG9.png) [and](https://i.imgur.com/QWkkFrY.png) [detailed](https://i.imgur.com/5kph5ah.png), and the color palette is soothing to the eye. The characters are [unique](http://i.imgur.com/wenmVb5.gif) and [distinct](https://i.imgur.com/Bx3Myw3.png) and [interact in humorous ways](https://streamable.com/mo1h). The pace is slow, and although Tanaka may be a little over-the-top with his listlessness, the show operates within the bounds of reality. And [Shiraishi’s subplot](https://i.imgur.com/kRsiwnR.png) may lead one to moe and yell [ganbatte](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3AOZrBbEgYY/Vy56jtEEPTI/AAAAAAAAcoo/Vd37F44QtVwGbtvUb73V-ORJ6slVTDypQCKgB/s1600/Omake%2BGif%2BAnime%2B-%2BTanaka-kun%2Bwa%2BItsumo%2BKedaruge%2B-%2BEpisode%2B5%2B-%2BShiraishi%2BResolved%2Bor%2BNot.gif)! It may be cheating to use a show literally about listlessness as an example of how to identify an iyashikei, but Tanaka-kun definitely exhibits all the signs of one. 

I hope I was able to shed some light on a wonderful genre and its inner-workings, and encourage you to go watch the three series that we studied if you haven’t already. (And I hope my essay wasn’t *too* relaxing and put you to sleep).

A fantastic WT! was already written for this by /u/redundan that can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5hg56d/wt_scorching_ping_pong_girls_shakunetsu_no/) I just wanted to provide my own perspective now that the anime has finished airing!


**tl;dr**: A surprise sleeper of the fall 2016 season, Scorching Ping Pong Girls blends meaningful character development with insane amounts of sakuga and a killer soundtrack into a cohesive anime about middle-schoolers playing competitive ping pong. It manages to balance “cute girls doing cute things” with high action matches (and some minor fanservice) to deliver an anime to that would make anyone’s heart go doki doki.

***

#Introduction:

When the fall 2016 season of anime started, I was a bit overly ambitious and couldn’t keep up with all of the new shows I added to my list. Trimming it down, I kept all the crowd favorites, Hibike!, Flip Flappers, etc. But it was only after I started to catch up with everything else that I found a true hidden gem.

At first glance, “Scorching Ping Pong Girls” looks like blatant pandering and a cash grab, but under the surface are some great characters, tense moments, and overall everything is brilliantly executed.

#What is Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume?:

Scorching Ping Pong Girls begins with the shy Tsumujikaze Koyori [unexpectedly running into Kamiya Agari](http://i.imgur.com/hA4qhDt.png), who just happens to be the table tennis team’s ace. A lover of ping pong herself, Koyori decides to join the team and thus starts her journey through heart-wrenching matches, against opponents of [all different](http://i.imgur.com/f40Oz8H.png) [kinds of](http://i.imgur.com/XAXiHyQ.png) [styles](http://i.imgur.com/rHeX9U3.png) ([and some peculiar ones](http://i.imgur.com/zEf6EoT.png)), while discovering that her love of ping pong can only grow.

#Why should you watch it?

##Realistic portrayal of its subject material

When I first started watching Keijo!!!!!!!! I wasn’t exactly sure what I was expecting, but it quickly became apparent that they weren’t going for realism with moves such as the “Vacuum Butt Cannon” and “Wedgie Acceleration.” And for Scorching Ping Pong Girls I was kind of expecting more of the same along the lines of Kuroko no Basket, because how many techniques can there be in table tennis anyway?

Apparently quite a few, and the anime doesn’t even explore all of the styles it can! Every technique shown has a basis in reality and oftentimes reflects the executor’s own personality and philosophy of the world. [There are a few exaggerated moments for emphasis sake](https://my.mixtape.moe/ghrqww.mp4), but all in all Scorching Ping Pong Girls remains faithful to its subject material.

##[Stunning animation](https://sakugabooru.com/data/4a1997bafd0c4ba681edd1ddf23f9031.mp4)

I wasn’t expecting much, but you can really tell that the animators put their [heart](https://my.mixtape.moe/hvdolu.mp4) [and](https://sakugabooru.com/data/1edc059c193cee23af3fa1ea5c56c2d6.mp4) [soul](https://my.mixtape.moe/urtqxk.mp4) into animating each individual match. Unfortunately due to time constraints, they’ll sometime skip portions of a match, but it’s worth it to see what makes it on screen. They do a good job of allowing one to visualize each player’s style of table tennis in an intuitive way. 

And even not looking at all of the sakuga packed into this anime, the general art-style is [pretty to look at](https://sakugabooru.com/data/a92301d4b5aba3cc49d22c4d4a1c2f0e.mp4). Vibrant colors and [interesting](http://static.zerochan.net/Ushirode.Kiruka.full.2041090.jpg) [character](http://static.zerochan.net/Tsumujikaze.Koyori.full.2041088.jpg) [designs](https://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/192371.jpg) abound, I think the art level is appropriate and a good medium between super detailed and allowing the animators to focus on the action. This footage in [this scene in particular](https://my.mixtape.moe/gwjxhx.mp4) feels like it was straight from a real tournament match.

For a quick overview, just go back up to the top of this page and watch the OP. It’s one of the best I’ve seen in a while, showcasing a teaser of both the show’s animation and soundtrack. In addition, most of the episodes give the viewer a reason to watch the opening, often including a short intense speech or moment from the episode to serve as a teaser for what’s to come.

##Fleshed out characters

For most of the anime, the top six ranked club members are most featured, and tend to follow your standard archetypes. You have your [genki](http://i.imgur.com/QuozW0I.png) [blonde girl](http://i.imgur.com/OYDw63O.png), the [blue-haired](http://i.imgur.com/qXHmk8r.png) [calm and collected one](http://i.imgur.com/zxFZKgI.png), [the lazy senpai](http://i.imgur.com/Qh7C6ut.png) ([who loves to dress up her](http://i.imgur.com/I5ONfoE.png) [kouhais](http://i.imgur.com/30qdd1f.png)) and the “[how is that girl in middle school?!](http://i.imgur.com/qcei0qX.png)” But it would be remiss of one to simply take these characters at their archetype’s face value.

Most of these characters have interesting backstories and plights that make them more relatable to the viewer, and wrestle with these situations and insecurities as they prepare and play their matches. Even the main antagonist that shows up towards the second half isn’t mindlessly “evil”, but rather has her own reasons for trying as hard as she can to crush her opponents. 

All of this circles back ground to the main character, whose unconditional love for ping pong is able to reignite that spark in her opponents, allowing the static and stress of their lives to seem little more than an afterthought, drowned by the ~~doki doki~~beating of their racing hearts.

What's even more amazing is that, towards the end, the generic looking first-years begin to come into their own as well, their aspirations and desires crystallizing due to them watching the effort of their seniors. In a lot of anime where the characters are poorly written, you can't quite get a feel for what the characters lives are like off-screen. Scorching Ping Pong Girls is able to frame the characters lives in a way where it doesn't feel like they live just for the viewer's entertainment.

##Amazing music

Music production studio MONACA provides the soundtrack for Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume, who have done work for notable series such as the Monogatari series and Oregairu. There were legitimately moments in this anime where I could not help but smile and move to the music. MONACA provides the perfect complement to the series’ crazy animation, allowing one to feel pumped up and excited when necessary.

##Miscellaneous

Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume is also paced extraordinarily well. No arcs outstay their welcome, and the series bounces back and forth between exploring backstories of its cast to keep things fresh. Over time, new faces are introduced but not in a way that seems jarring, but instead leaves one excited to see what they bring to the game.

Comedy in Shakunetsu fits quite well and is as adorable as you’d expect from this kind of show. Koyori is one of those characters who is extremely shy and withdrawn until racket meets ball. Due to this, she tends to get flustered quite easily, much to the amusement of her classmates, who do their best to support their new friend.

Also...there’s some pretty heavily implied yuri for those of you that are into that^^^I'mintothat

#Conclusion

Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume was one of my sleeper hits and a joy for me to watch during the fall 2016 season. It simply oozed fun, and it was incredibly endearing to see these girls chase their dream of reaching Nationals, and learn about themselves and others in the process. With some great sakuga, music to jam out to, and characters to fall in love with, I had a beaming smile on my face the whole time, and I hope that I got a couple more people’s hearts to go doki doki with me.

**Watch This**: ReLife

**Type**: TV (13 episodes)

**Year**: 2016 (Summer)

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30015/ReLIFE)

**My personal rating**: 9/10

**Introduction**

[“This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—you go back to high school and hang out with cute girls. You don’t take the blue pill…well we know what you’ll choose.” – Morpheus-san](http://i.imgur.com/xoswBXq.png)

ReLife follows Kaizaki Arata, a man that, due to many unfortunate circumstances, fails at every job interview he has after leaving his last company. Disillusioned with life, he gets approached by a Yoake Ryou, a researcher for the ReLife Research Institute, and gets offered the chance to change his appearance and relive his high school days for one year.

**Why should you watch it?**

ReLife is a slice-of-life comedy with some romance elements. At first I didn’t know what to think in regards to the premise, and depending on what direction it took this anime could have been really creepy. Instead, I found an incredibly touching and realistic portrayal of newly budding relationships (both romantic and non-romantic). Kaizaki himself takes inspiration from his fellow classmates’ troubles, and obtains new perspective on his own adult troubles.

Drama in ReLife is dealt with incredibly realistically. Each character reacts as you would expect a high schooler to react. Some might find this annoying, but I found it incredibly refreshing, and instead of coming up with some convoluted solution, things resolve very much in the way you’d expect them to. ReLife takes the emotions and uncertainties one often experiences in high school and lays them out for you to live again… but this time they’ve got someone who’s been through it all to help guide them, Kaizaki.

Speaking of Kaizaki, it’s refreshing that we get a character in a school slice-of-life that isn’t socially inept. He’s been through it all before, and is able to pick up on the feelings of the juniors around him, subtly being a bro and nudging things into place. As someone who’s near Kaizaki’s age, he acts very much how I think I’d act in his situation, amused but caring. He knows that to a high schooler, everything that happens seems like the most important thing in the world to them, because that’s all they have to go on. They haven’t developed the wisdom that comes with experience, and Kaizaki serves as a catalyst for them to obtain that wisdom.

ReLife is also pretty funny. Kaizaki gets into a lot of misunderstandings due to his unique situation (in the very first episode he gets caught with a [pack of cigarettes](http://i.imgur.com/uBaAwqE.png) in his backpack). The comedy in ReLife is very down to earth. Nothing over the top or really crazy happens, a lot of the comedy is based on one of the main character’s social incompetence. It had me laughing quite a bit, and the comedic moments have the characters change into these [chibi](http://i.imgur.com/rWdh86Q.png) [ones](http://i.imgur.com/jywK0JB.png) that are adorable. 

All in all, ReLife is an incredibly heartwarming anime with great character interactions and character development. By the end of the anime, each character has grown a substantial amount, and has learned a lot about relationships along the way. It would be a shame if someone missed out on watching ReLife just because of the way it was released, because it's one of the best character-driven SoL I've seen.",[WT!] ReLife

The assassin walked amongst her comrades, making her way to the River. Chirps and chatters began to die out as they neared, and the sky seemed to dim at the sight of Dire land.

The warriors fought in vain, albeit valiantly. They fell, only to be resurrected, fighting in the name of the gods. Lanaya only felt pity.


*Forever destined to fight, but content to be ignorant of the mysteries* she thought.

Her ears twitched.

She crouched to the ground, scanning her environment. Someone was here...there. A branch cracked.

She sprang forward, her right arm swiping in a wide arc in front of her. A flash of pink, then the smell of singed fabric.

""Woah ho ho!"" screamed the Storm Spirit, nursing his singed hand. The templar assassin only smiled.

They continued to trade blows, all the while assisting their mates in their never ending battle. Raijin the Storm Spirit ran around jovially, constantly attempting conversation with the assassin. All he got in return was silence.

Another twitch of the ears.

Snaps and crackles exploded in her head, deafening her. She gave a twirl of her wrist, creating a shimmering aura that surrounded her, but it would give her no respite. She turned to meet face to face with the embodiment of lightning.

""Who's **that** handsome devil?!"" A voice called out from behind her. The remnant exploded, releasing countless volts of electricity into the air. Lanaya stood her ground, energy inches away from her face. Her aura shimmered, once, twice. She smiled.

Her hands worked quickly, artfully carving their air to her liking. Blades shot out from her fingertips, shooting towards their target with sheer force of mind. Raijin ran, whimpering, his jollyness lost. Lanay's hands shot forward, channeling the energies of the temple she knew so well.

""Spring!"" she shouted, as her trap exploded, singing the Storm Spirit's legs. For a moment, she disappeared, only to seemingly burst out of a different dimension, only with immense power. She slung a great blade of energy that buried itself into Raijin. With one last yell he was no more.

""The only mystery was how you lasted so long.""

An arrow soared through the air, burying itself where Lyrelei's hand was a moment before. She spun around, bow already primed to fire. Across the way stood a silver-haired vixen, dressed in a cool blue. Her hand reached toward her quiver, but a second too late.

Ropes spun through the air, enveloping themselves around the Drow Ranger, binding her limbs before latching themselves onto a nearby tree. 

""This is surprising Traxex!"" Lyrelei said, pulling the drawstring of her bow taut, ""I didn't see you as a tree-hugger!"" Lyrelei smiled. But so did Traxex. 

The Ranger jerked her arm up, slicing through her binds with the head of the arrow she retrieved. A single finger went to her lips.

The Windrunner's arms froze, releasing the arrow prematurely. She turned to run, closing her eyes to call the winds to her aid, but they did not listen. Sluggishly she ran, chilled to her bones. 

""Just needed some cooling down"" Drow said, chuckling at the joke. Her bow came up one last time, her arrow enveloped in an icy haze. It fired true. And the Windrunner ran no more.

""My arrow found your arrow's mark.""

I.**Introduction:**

Hey friends! First and foremost I want to thank you for taking out the time to read this guide. I hope I can help you improve in this facet of your Dota 2 play, so you can enjoy supporting as much as I do.

*Who am I?*

I am a college student with too much time on his hands. I am not a pro player by any means; however I have played the original Dota Allstars, as well as having been a Heroes of Newerth beta player. Of course, I’ve logged countless hours into Dota 2! If that still does not satisfy you, judge me on the merit of my work and not my transcript. :)

*What is supporting?*

Everyone likes Batman right? All he does is smash in peoples’  faces, while looking as badass as ever. 
You will not be Batman. 
You’re going to be someone much more important. 
Sure you scream, “DrJWilson! Who could be more important than Batman?! This guide sucks!” Think about this. Who nurtured Batman when he was just known as Bruce? Who heals his wounds, gives him confidence, and provides the support he needs to be badass? 
Yup. You’re gonna be Alfred.

Supporting is the role that keeps the team together. Supporters die for their carries, protect their teammates, and all around better the team as a whole. A team without supporters would crumble almost immediately, as everyone competes for farm and kills. So let’s get into how to actually support!

II.**Warding:**

Warding is one of the most important duties of a supporter. Here are some benefits of wards.

* 	Wards provide vision
        	
This seems obvious, but vision does tremendous things for a team. Vision foils enemy team ganks that would have been devastating, while facilitating your own.

Vision also allows you to know when certain places are safe, e.g. when Roshan is open to kill without the enemy team knowing.
	
A testimony to vision: Why is Beastmaster picked in some professional games? Some people would assume it to be the ultimate; it is a good AoE crowd control, and a good initiation. However, it is his pets that give the most use! His bird is useful for scouting enemy positions and destroying the enemy team wards.

* It gives you the potential to deny the enemy team’s vision
Wards allow you to see when the other team is warding. This information is invaluable as that means that you can counter-ward their ward in the future, but technique is a bit advanced and such will be discussed in “Advanced supporting.”

Now that you know some of the benefits, let’s get down to the actual ward placements.

*Offensive:*

Offensive wards are used offensively. This means that these wards are used for ganking the enemy team, or just generally constricting the area they can be in. For example, if you have a ward near the enemy’s secret shop, you can see when they would be headed there and kill them.
*Defensive:*

Defensive wards are used defensively. These wards allow you vision of key areas of your side of the map that you need to have vision of, including your jungle and secret shop. These disable the enemy team’s ability to gank your jungle effectively, and can allow you to bounce back due to the fact that you can now safely farm your jungle and ancients without the fear of being killed.

Of course these aren't every single ward spot, but they're good places to start for a newbie, they provide either vision of the tablets or vision of the enemy team's jungle. If you would like more, check out DotaCinema on YouTube as they have great videos on warding.

*When should I place my wards?*

Ideally, you should place your wards when your team has killed some of the enemy heroes. However, this will not always be the case. Here are some guidelines.

*Place wards when all enemy heroes are accounted for.

If you can clearly see that all five enemy heroes are currently elsewhere, then you are clear to place your wards.

* Use the buddy system.

Pretend you’re in Kindergarten again. Grab a partner, preferably someone with a stun or slow, and have them be your bodyguard as you go about warding. If they refuse, find someone else who will come with you.

* 	Place wards while passing by.

If you’re already in the river headed towards top to help defend the tower, why not place a ward as you’re passing the spot?!

III.**Positioning:**

Positioning as a support hero can be one of the most delicate things in Dota 2. Here are some guidelines and diagrams for positioning yourself.

* 	Know the range of hero spells.

For example, if you’re in a lane against Lina and Lion, be aware of how far their stuns can reach, and be out of their range! Be prepared to defend your carry if they decide to initiate.

Knowing ranges meaning knowing your own as well! You should know the ranges of your bread and butter spells so you can assist in a gank or defend your carry when the time comes.

*  Try not to block your carry.

Your carry needs to get last hits to get the items he needs. Some players absent-mindedly walk back and forth and constantly bump into their lane partner, don’t be one of those guys! 

While chasing someone this is especially important. Stay off to the side, but still in range of your spells, so your carry can deal their damage and ultimately get the kill.

* Team fights

In a team fight, you are the priority of the other team. Be sure to stay far back so they can not pick you off before the fight even begins.  Of course, if you’re an initiating support like Tidehunter or Sand King this doesn’t apply to you.

Focus on buffing your carry and disabling theirs.

Remember to use activated items! Things like Pipe of Insight and Mechanism can swing fights towards your way.

**IV. Phases:**

Dota 2 is split up into 3 distinct phases of gameplay. Your duties as a support change based on what phase the game is currently in.

* Laning

This phase is characterized by having heroes in their lanes, getting early farm with last hits.

During the laning phase, you should be harassing as much as possible. Harassing is poking out to auto-attack a hero and darting back behind your creeps.

Harassing also serves another purpose, when you attack another hero you attract their team’s creeps. This will slightly pull the lane back towards your side of the map, allowing you to be safer.

Since you will be attracting the enemy team’s creeps, you want to spend little time attacking. The idea to think of is “pot-shots.” Attack, move back, wait, repeat.

Sometimes the middle lane hero will come by to gank. Always communicate and coordinate with your teammates. Tell him/her to ping when they are committing to the kill, or tell you over voice chat. From there you use whatever crowd control you have to assist in the kill.

Remember not to actually take the kill! Leave it to your carry, he needs the gold a lot more than you do.

You will be doing some warding during the laning phase, but typically it is only on one side of the river. 

* Ganking

This phase is filled with countless roaming from heroes in all lanes. This phase usually starts when heroes are around level 6.

Assist your team in ganks whenever possible. If your carry feels comfortable, feel free to leave your lane to gank the other ones, such as assisting middle lane or teleporting to the opposite lane.


Help out your teammates! Whenever you see another lane getting ganked, use a teleport scroll as fast as possible to save your friends, and possibly get a kill while you’re there.

Wards are the most important during this phase. Try to keep at least wards in the river up, ideally you should have wards in the enemy team jungle as well.

* Team fights

This phase is filled with high action fights between both teams.

* Stay on the edge of the combat, so you don’t get picked off early.

* Use your crowd control on the most important people, including the enemy team carry and their supporters.

* If you have a high damage nuke, e.g. Lion’s Finger of Death and Lina’s Laguna blade, use it immediately! It is better to have the enemy team off to a bad start than to give you one measly kill. Most of the time you want to use it on the enemy team’s carry.

* This guideline goes for Zeus as well, his ultimate during the later stages of the game is best used right when a team fight starts, not for kill stealing.

V. **Advanced Supporting:**

These techniques are a bit more advanced than basic supporting, so use these after you are comfortable with using a support hero and have the basics down pat.

* Counterwarding

Earlier I mentioned that having vision is good. That means, if you have a possibility to remove the enemy team’s vision, they don’t have that benefit to use. Counterwarding removes the enemy team’s vision, leaving them in the dark as to where you are while you keep tabs on them.

Every time you successfully counter ward you gain some of the money back. This is a relatively simple thing to do that gives you a big advantage at a low cost, so do it!

Sentry wards have a big range of reveal, but they need a ward of sight to actually see something. Therefore a good time to counterward is when you’re already warding anyway.

In some cases, buying a Gem of True Sight is a great deal, since it allows you to counterward while defending against smoke ganks and invisible enemy heroes.

Protip: If you are using Venomancer, you can put your poison wards up onto cliffs to counterward for free with a gem!

Beastmaster also benefits from this using his bird.

The first day me and my buddies come in, and I teach them how to squat. One of my friends has moderate to severe kyphosis, so his squat looks wonky. I let him complete the movement, and am about to tell him how to fix his issues when this lady comes storming towards me. She tells me she knows that we're new here, and that was terrible squat form.

She then tries to explain to us how to do a squat. This involves using the sissy pad, because it's ""safer"", and then tells us to step **forwards** out of the rack. This means you would step **backward** to rerack the weight, which is incredibly dangerous, and just plain bad.

I have about 5 acres to mow each week and managed to score a Great Dane Chariot Jr 52"" about 10 years ago on Craigslist that has served me well. Just got a call back from the shop that my wheel motor is going and a replacement part (just the part) would be $1100 (I independently confirmed this). The Great Dane company has been gone for a while and replacement parts have been getting kinda hard to come by (sometimes the parts aren't hard to find, but mapping the old GD part to the proper replacement is a nightmare), so I'm considering leaving the motor dodgy and just replacing her once it finally goes.

- Does that approach (selling/junking her in lieu of the $1100 part) make sense?

- If I do so, what are good brands to be looking for in the meantime? 

- How much of a discount should I expect to see going used on Craigslist vs new? My wife really wants a new one, but if I'm talking $2K for CL and $8K for new, I have trouble justifying the $6K difference.

I handled the logistics and tech support to buy her an XPS 13 9350 plus the $200 docking station and get her all setup (it's like a Macbook Air only cheaper faster and familar Windows, yay!)... I've had nothing but regrets since then... (FWIW I'm a programmer that's reasonably tech savvy, I build my own desktops, do my own laptop surgeries, etc)  

- Drivers for the USB-C and Dock were terrible. I spent easily 10 hours mucking around with drivers and firmware just to try to get the thing to work properly. If I'd been installing Linux unsupported I'd expect this sort of trouble but not for a year old Dell laptop running OOTB Windows and the recommended docking station. 

- 9 months in she told me the screen stopped working. External monitors still worked, and the screen showed the Dell logo on boot. She mentioned that it seemed really hot around the time. I noted that the screen had a cosmetic dent on the outer bezel corner, she'd gotten months earlier. Seemed unrelated (that comes up later).

- I took it for evaluation to see if I could fix it. Safe mode windows worked, BIOS screen worked, system eval passed etc. But normal Windows boot in full res was black screen 100% of the time. I wasted another 10+ hours screwing around with drivers assuming it was a driver problem 

- After exhausting all those channels some coworkers suggested that it probably was a dead GPU and the thing needed a new mobo. Called Dell. Got an RMA after a few hours of haggling since they claimed it was out of warranty b/c they had it listed as being sold to Adorama. Got that fixed sent it away. 

- Get a call claiming that it's user damage that broke the screen. Caller cannot discuss details b/c he doesn't have warehouse photos. I explain that the screen damage is cosmetic, the screen works fine, I believe the computer overheated and GPU is dead. He said they'll call back. 

- Call back. Again Dell insists user damage. Say I have to pay $239 or they'll ship the comp back. I ask if they can eval the mobo and then call back. ""No"". I agree to pay (my MIL has now been without a comp for a month, I can't just wait for them to mail it back broken), but ask what happens if they replace the LCD only to find that it wasn't the screen but the mobo. ""You'll get a full detailed manifest on return sir"". (Paying took an extra hour b/c of Dell system problems, having to call back twice to pay Dell money I shouldn't have to pay was its own special hell)

- Got it back today. Good news: It seems fixed. Infuriating news: They replaced the LCD and **the heat sink and the mobo**. I was right, the screen was fine, they were just too lazy/incompetent to properly evaluate it. 

Anybody have any suggestions on getting that $239 refunded? B/c if I can't, I'm going to have to start recommending Macs to friends and family, and I really don't want to do that.

I just posted a top 1000 raid first to finish leaderboard here: https://www.d2checklist.com/leaderboard/leviathan/

This includes the top 1000 finishers as sorted by game id, so the list should be definitive (this is improved over my old D1 leaderboards). Huge thanks to Destiny Trials Report for the underlying data to this!

- You can click on the ""rank"" value in a match to see the post game carnage report

- Fireteams are sorted by most kills

- You can click on a gamer tag to see their player profile

- If available, you can click on a Twitch link to see twitch clips associated with the match

- You can filter the list by gamertag.

- You can append a filter to the URL if you want to prefilter the list. Like this: https://www.d2checklist.com/leaderboard/leviathan/sc_slayerage. If you were the 578th finisher and want to share with your friends without making them click, this can be handy

- There were 5 VERY large fireteams that completed this. I assume folks worked in shifts (one team took 19 hours to complete the raid). They ended up with fireteams over 32 players, which causes Bungie to strip gamertags from the post game report. I've painstakingly recovered their GT's for the leaderboard, but if you click on once of those post game reports the names will be blank since it's missing from the PGCR.

If you have any questions, problems or suggestions, comment below, msg me, or post over on /r/destinychecklistnet  Thanks!

Edit: Note that ""duration"" is the duration of the match where a team completed the raid.

You might remember me from Destiny 1 where I run www.destinychecklist.net. Anyway, I've been hard at work since D2 dropped making a new site from scratch to help track similar things, and it's out now at www.d2checklist.com. Below is a detailed guide to the features and how to use them. Thanks!

# Goals

- Report handy general info about Destiny 2 players and characters, with a focus towards optimzing your weekly loot. Try to fill a similar niche to what Destinychecklist.net for Destiny 1
- Perform as quickly as possible and display well in both regular browsers and on mobile

# Player reporting

[From the home page](https://www.d2checklist.com) you can search for players by platform type and gamertag just like most sites. If your search doesn't find anything, you can click to try another platform or use the [Bungie profile search page](https://www.d2checklist.com/search), while that can't search by gamertag, if your friend's GT is similar to their Bungie Profile display name (it usually is) then it can help with typos. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/sgd4xK3.gif) is me realizing sc_SlayerAge has an underscore in his name using that feature.

Once you get to a [player page](https://www.d2checklist.com/2/sc_slayerage/) you'll see when the person last played, including what they're doing right now if they're actively playing. If they're on Xbox, it also has a link to pop up XBL messaging and send them a message from your browser. There are 3 tabs: https://i.imgur.com/hoh7DOB.gif

- **Checklist** - This is the weekly milestone completions. You can use to see if your friend has done the Nightfall or Raid yet. Or that you still need to do the Flashpoint on your Hunter. (This will show lifetime raid completions soon as well, but that endpoint hasn't been released yet)
- **Progress** - This is your current faction standings **sorted by next to rank up**. If you're in a hurry to figure out where to turn in stuff to rank up, this is helpful. (I'm considering making a screen where, if you're signed in and looking at your own page this could also show what tokens and mats you have to turn in for each person, let me know if that's of interest).
- **Chars** - A list of all the chars, their level and light level, when they last played and all their stats (strength, mobility, etc). This includes some weird hidden stats like ""Zoom"" that you can play around with if you're curious. Each char also has a link to their [activity history page](https://www.d2checklist.com/history/2/4611686018445232688/2305843009262569777).  

# Match History and PGCR's

From that Activity history page you can query up to the last 2000 matches for a player, filtered by type. I used this page when I was trying to find the PGCR for SlayerAge's [4 man of the raid](https://www.d2checklist.com/pgcr/293740061). Once you get the results, you can click the link to view directly the Post Game Carnage Report, which includes weapon stats, kill counts, who was on what Fireteam etc. https://i.imgur.com/UPBf2r5.gif

# Signing In

If you sign into the site, it gives access to the private Bungie endpoints. Eventually this will be used to evaluate and display the gear across all your characters, today it just gives us a few helpful pieces of info, which we use to display a new title bar with a few things. https://i.imgur.com/U0SDwAm.png

1) The ""My Clan"" button. Click this to view your clan's page, see below. If you actually know a clan ID, you don't need to sign in ahead of time, you can just visit the link directly. For example here's [my clan](https://www.d2checklist.com/clan/1985678) 

2) Your current currencies, glimmer/legendary shards/bright dust. I find this very helpful to be able to check while offline if I have the shards I'll need to buy from Xur.

# Clan Reporting

This page has a lot of useful info about your clan: https://i.imgur.com/KabH2sj.gif

- Clan's weekly milestone status
- Clan's progressions, including how much XP you have remaining towards the cap (the only active progression at the moment is the clan ranking, which has a 100K XP cap)
- A list of all the clan members, sortable by name or last played date, with their individual milestone info. (This can take a while to load if your clan is large, be patient as it loads in alphabetical order). You can click on their name to visit their player page directly (and the clan will continue loading in the background while you view it!)

This helps with questions like:

- I want to do the Nightfall/Raid, who in my clan still needs it? 
- Did the clan max out our weekly XP? If not, who can I message to do some daily challenges with?
 
I hope you find this helpful. If you have problems, questions or feature suggestions visit /r/destinychecklistnet

- Right now I have a 12x12 home gym room 80% floored in 3/4"" horse stall mats on top of carpet and padding on top of foundation concrete

- We're tearing the carpet out of our whole basement (and replacing with vinyl planking), which includes my gym. So now I need to figure out underflooring.

- How at risk is my foundation if I put the horse stall mats on top of the naked concrete? 

- If I'm at risk, how much would getting bumper plates help?

- If I do want to put something under the mats, how thick and how many layers?

I finally updated the clan/list page on [www.destinychecklist.net](https://www.destinychecklist.net) to track the updated Age of Triumph items (390 raids, weekly story, etc). With it, you can now see completions for your clan or a select list of friends. 

* [Search clans by putting the clan name](https://imgur.com/a/dnEwZ) in on the main page, make sure you get the XB1/PS4 setting right, clans span platforms but an Xbox clan will show empty for PS and vice versa.

This bill still needs a few Republican House Delegates to flip to support putting the bill to a vote in the house. You can [click here](http://www.mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmmain.aspx?pid=legisrpage&tab=subject6&poptype=find&popid=), enter your address and find your delegates. Calling is best, but you can also message all of them at once from that page. Ideally do both. Tell them to support putting SB1200, Internet Consumer Privacy Act, to a vote on the House floor.

> Earlier today, the Maryland Senate suspended its rules to allow a late filled bill on protecting Internet consumer privacy to be introduced. We only have five business days to get it through the process, but I'm confident we will succeed in protecting consumers in Maryland. The bill (SB1200), sponsored by Sen. Jim Rosapepe, has 27 cosponsors including me. The vote was 33 to 14 along party lines. Maryland Senate Democrats getting the people's work done.

From my non-lawyer reading of the law, it seems pretty good. It includes a consumer's browser history and/or IP address as ""Personally identifiable information"" so your ISP can't even sell your direct browser history or historical IP address, even without the name attached. It includes a reasonable exclusion for subpoena, court order, etc. Here's the text:

http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2017RS/bills/sb/sb1200f.pdf

I'm really impressed that the legislature was able to get this in super late in the session. My advice would be: 

- If you have a local Senator or Delegate that voted for this (i.e. they're a Democrat), call them and thank them

- If you have a local Senator or Delegate that voted against this (i.e. they're a Republican) call them and demand to know what their reasoning was

Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with this bill other than my interest in consumer privacy. Since we apparently can't get it at the national level anymore, it's great that our state can come through for us on short notice.","In party line vote (Dems for, GOP against), MD passes Browser History protection bill"

- Enhance vendor screen with more stat info and vendor reset dates (now that  all the vendors reset much more quickly)

- Add in Weekly story mode to the checklist (really a general revamp of the checklist entries to reflect what most folks would care about going forward). Then matching updates to the clain/list entries

Hey everybody, 

I just released a new spreadsheet oriented gear manager at https://gear.destinychecklist.net. It's similar to my chrome extension but doesn't require installing anything. The main goal is to give you a highly sortable and filterable view of your gear, while letting you tag things to Upgrade/Keep/Inuse/Shard. Your tags and notes are synced across all your devices, keyed by your Destiny accuont and it works on mobile as well (though with fewer data points b/c screen size). Here's a [few screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/DvKW5) if you're into that. 

Notable features: 

- I just added in /u/48klocs awesome [Percolator](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/5p1o02/percolator_for_all_your_weapon_selection_needs/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) logic to grade guns (same caveat as he gives that rolls are in the eye of the beholder)

- Total gun and armor XP is displayed, and that XP keeps going up even after a gun is fully leveled. This lets you see what gear you've used most throughout destiny. Apparently I've never fired a primary that wasn't a Grasp or Thorn...

- Mobile friendly, so you can see your tags on your phone and move stuff around there real quick

- Advanced filtering options like showing only equipped, only items in certain light ranges, min/max Armor quality percentages and more. This makes meticulous gear management a lot easier.

As always, I want to highlight that this isn't a fully featured gear manager. Personally I use [DIM](/r/DestinyItemManager) for that sort of thing. This is down and dirty obsessive gear management and inventory clearance. I hope this helps some folks make their life easier sifting through piles of Iron Banner loot.

I've finished a complete rewrite based off my Chrome extension using Bungie's new Oauth. Check it out at https://gear.destinychecklist.net

- Mobile friendly

- Neat feature to see how much XP each item has, to see what you've used the most

- Gear is intelligently moved (no more clicking to move to vault, then back; items are de-equipped and moved through the steps to get there in one flick)

- Favorite tagging, with a dedicated favorite tab to quickly see your most important items

- A bunch of new filtering options (including leveled vs not, stat split on armor, min and max qual % etc)

Please try it out and let me know what you think.

A few weeks ago ppl were asking about a way to look at their extended PVP match history. I built a solution out just as the Bungie Stats API bit the dust (which you might have noticed as it bedeviled your favorite ELO site tracking at Trials Report, Tracker or Guardian.gg), so didn't bother announcing it anywhere til now that it seems to be back.

Here's a shot of the how to do it: http://imgur.com/a/3iVVY

Here's a screenshot of one of my reports after opening in Excel and formatting as a table: http://imgur.com/a/5FnYJ

To use it: 

1) Install the Chrome extension (it's underlying service layer is based on DIM) https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/destinychecklistnet-sprea/feapilfcgikmmcdhledhnaefdjjfdomm (The extension does a bunch of other stuff, but we'll just worry about CSV history in this post.)

2) Click the ""PvP"" tab

3) Click the ""PVP History CSV"" button and select your char. 

4) Wait a little while b/c it has to download your data in chunks of 100 matches

5) Do whatever the heck you'd like with the resultant CSV file. Personally I load it in excel, select all, double click the columns to fix their widths, the click ""format as table"" and start perusing.

Caveats: 

- We'll see if the Bungie Stats endpoint stays up and stable, if it goes down this will start returning an error message.

- The report uses the bulk match report calls, (downloading PCGR's for potentially thousands of matches in an extension will probably just end up with Bungie banning my API key) so the data isn't super fine grained (it has K/D, score, win loss etc). If you want gun performance reports or stuff like that, you'll want to stick with the most recent 200 matches that you'll see on the rest of that PvP page.

So I've been running for over 20 years now, dealt with my share of injuries, and I'm hoping someone here might help me figure out what to do with this new minor issue. I trained for a half marathon over the last few months (just under 8 min/mile pace) and just finished my race last week with success. From Day 1 training, I started experiencing mild Achilles pain in both ankles, but more in my left ankle. This caught my attention b/c I've basically never had such pain before, typically I would have IT band, rolled ankle or mild shin splints if I was overtraining or otherwise unlucky, never Achilles pain. FWIW I should mention that I pretty seriously sprained that ankle 10 years ago and it is a bit less stable than my right ankle (no Dr has noticed it, but a running store employee pointed that out to me a while back).

I also have a weird situation where my [medial malleolus](http://www.physioadvisor.com.au/wp-content/uploads/12793256300x300.jpg) (i.e. the bony inner part of my ankle) would be super sensitive to getting tapped by anything. Say I might be eating dinner barefoot and happen to tap my inner ankle on the kitchen chair and I'd practically fold up in pain.

I would have little to no pain while running, in terms of the Achilles or other ankle pain it would be mostly after getting up in the morning or otherwise sitting still for a long period, a simple ankle stretch would go a long way.

In the middle of my training, I visited a podiatrist to make sure I didn't have anything too serious going on (like, say, Achilles tendinosis). He checked my range of motion and did a simple X-ray of both ankles and said everything looked fine, no Achilles calcification, flattening arches, or other concerns. I continued training while being mindful of anything getting worse and it stayed at a reasonable level, and I even managed to PR on the race last weekend.  The podiatrist didn't seem concerned but was like ""If you really want to, you can pay for an MRI and/or bone scan, but I don't think you need it"".

So now that the race is done I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to get my ankle back in order for many years of happy running, but I'm a bit stumped about what I'm even dealing with here. Google seems to be pointing me in a few directions: 

- Posterior Tibial Tendonitis

- Some sort of stress fracture

- You're getting older and stuff just hurts, don't worry about it

Anyone dealt with anything similar and have any advice on how to move forward? Thanks!","Mild achilles, medial ankle pain. Thoughts?"

Just wanted to give a quick heads up that I've made several enhancements to www.destinychecklist.net to help folks looking to raise their light in RoI. The biggest one is probably that the site now tracks your nearest to ranking factions on the main player page. Here's [an example](https://www.destinychecklist.net/tabs/1/luvinx) account. 

A few other notes while I'm here: 

- Shiro, new Shaxx, Dreadnaught Crota Bounty, and Queen's Wrath are all tracked now (most via estimation on weekly rep progress)

- A very loose approximation of whether you've done the Daily Public Event is reported, with a handy link to DestinyPublicEvents.com in case you're also on the prowl for marks (up to 45 marks per day via those events, 15 per char). This is handled based on your daily vanguard rep progress, so it can report a false positive, so be warned.

- The player list/clan page now also includes most of those additions ([example](https://www.destinychecklist.net/list/1/luvinx,MagneticRubber,Modern%20Tryhard))

- You can use the little heart icon next to your name on the player page to hit the shared quests/bounties page (or just to [here](https://www.destinychecklist.net/venn/) or to www.VennDestiny.com). Here's [an example](https://www.destinychecklist.net/venn/1/Modern%20Tryhard/Magnetic%20Rubber/luvinx) 

- All the old Raid and lifetime completions, nighfalls, etc, is still around. You can still keep your LFG teammates honest by seeing if they're telling the truth when they swear they already beat the new raid 100 times.

- The tracking table on the main player page can be customized by dragging and dropping each table row to reorder them, or by clicking the icon to remove them. So if you don't even plan on doing Challenge of Elders again, just click that minus icon and forget about it.

- Things should be relatively mobile friendly and as fast as possible (the Bungie API is stretched a little thin with the new ROI players, so you still may be slow, but rest assured things have been re-shuffled to keep performance as fast as possible anyway).

**---------------- Now returning to original post ---------**
 

Hey folks, 

**TL;DR I made a Chrome extension that downloads your game reports and analyzes your K/D and other stats on a per gun basis. [You can try it here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/destinychecklistnet-spead/feapilfcgikmmcdhledhnaefdjjfdomm).** [Here's what it looks like reporting on games](http://imgur.com/a/47GZ7) and here's an example of the [final report table](http://imgur.com/a/2nQPP) (in this case sorted to show the guns I've gotten the most kills per game with).

#Long Version

A while back I made a Chrome extension that gives a spreadsheet view of gear, lets you tag it, and such (the underlying service layer uses DIM's Bungie Service). A few hundred people use it, and I contributed the ""download a spreadsheet feature"" to DIM, which a lot more people probably use. But at it's heart it's my little one-off extension that I play around with for whatever I want. 

The other weekend I got curious about trying to figure out how I did with some guns versus others. While the Bungie API is really amazing, this is actually *really* hard to do, since you need to download individual PostGameCarnageReport's to get unique gun data for a player. I originally wanted to put something like this up on www.destinychecklist.net, but I couldn't figure out a way to do it that scaled without a much bigger infrastructure than I'm interested in maintaining (the DestinyTrials Report guys do maintain such an infrastructure, and offer data like this for just Trials data; but I personally rarely play trials). 

This extension solves it by downloading the games into local cache for the extension and analyzing them in place. *Loading a lot of games will be slow at first*, but it will save those PCGR's and future reports for games already saved should be pretty quick. 

I have a [FAQ](http://www.destinychecklist.net/extensionFAQ) for it here, but should call out that **only games where you get a kill with a gun can be counted**. For example, if you're like me you will probably find your heavy weapons show a lower use count than your primaries, b/c some games I may not get any kills with heavy. Likewise, any stat that's not ""actual kills"" gives credit for all game kills to all guns that were listed in the PGCR. So if you run Mida and Party Crasher, get 20 kills, 19 with PC+1 and 1 with Mida, all while only dying 10 times, both MIDA and PC+1 gets credit for that 2.0 K/D game. If you had a Ruin Wake equipped with heavy and got zero kills with it, that gun gets no credit b/c it simply doesn't show up in the PGCR at all. 

Anyway, I thought it might be useful to folks over here, if you try it out and like it or hate it, let me know below or msg me or post in /r/destinychecklistnet where I post more minor updates. Thanks!


PS. While I'm here, one other thing I've made which might be of some interest to crucible-minded folks: If you strive to complete the Shaxx True Meaning of War bounty on a regular basis, you may find the main player page on destinychecklist.net ([here's Lumi's](http://www.destinychecklist.net/tabs/2/Luminosity48)) helpful, as it will track which of your players hold the the TMOW bounty, and which have completed it. [Screenshot example](http://imgur.com/a/b7Gfq)

Anyway, I hope some folks find this all helpful. The guides, input, etc from this sub have been helpful to me!

**Edit #1**: I appreciate the warm response. Some excellent points were made below and I've just pushed version 1.2.1 which should show up for users in an hour or so (after 10PM EST you can try force upgrading in your chrome extensions if you're in a hurry). Fixes/enhancements are:

- Fixed bug where sorting didn't always make sense

- Made UI for KD KDA AVG score prettier

- Added a ""Hide guns used less than X games"" filter so that one time you used a blue gun and got a 10.0 KD with it doesn't muck up your views.

- Theoretically fixed games with 0 deaths to not skew your KD as much (someone that dies less than me will have to check me on this one)

Things to think about for the future: 

- Potentially allow downloading > 100 games per char

- Consider adding Combat Rating or ELO to somehow account for quality of competition when weighting games

More details are [here in the FAQ](http://www.destinychecklist.net/extensionFAQ) but in short, it analyzes up to 300 games and reports back on your K/D and other data for each game that you used each gun in. This is something that is hard to do in the API so the extension handles it better.

As things have gotten a bit boring with the content drought leading up to ROI, I figured I'd put up some weekly leaderboards to help keep folks entertained in the meantime. I've setup:

* [A PVP Kill Leaderboard](http://www.destinychecklist.net/leaderPvp): Top 50 individual kill counts in ANY Pvp mode for the week.

* [A Challenge of Elders Team High Score Leaderboard](http://www.destinychecklist.net/leaderCoe): Top 50 team scores for Challenge of Elders this week

You can also easily access the boards from the [navbar](http://imgur.com/YnT8ji0) on the rest of www.destinychecklist.net.

A couple notes, which I go into more detail here in the [FAQ](http://www.destinychecklist.net/leaderFAQ):

* This is **not** a definitive leaderboard. This is a leaderboard of every gamertag that filters through the site for the week via the regular account reporting page. Sometimes Bungie will release CoE high scores, I'm sure Bungie is actually parsing through their entire data set, which is definitive. Unfortunately it's not realistic for me to mine Bungie's entire data set, and they don't offer a ""search by high score"" type function yet.

* To ""enter"" in the board, just track a gamertag on the main page after completing the event. So go [here](http://www.destinychecklist.net/) and type in your gamertag at the top and click the little search button. I had a reasonable data set last week just from silently gathering data from regular site users, [top kill count in PVP was 45
](http://www.destinychecklist.net/leaderPvp/20160705) and [top CoE score was 78k](http://www.destinychecklist.net/leaderCoe/20160705). 

Fun things I've seen since silently setting this up last week to test out: 

- Rift was is the best place to kill a lot of Guardians (at least in any week where Zone Control isn't around). 8 of the top 10 kill counts in Pvp were Rift (Control was next best, with just a few Mayhem Clash's also showing up).

- The time penalty in CoE doesn't seem to be a big deal, 5 of the top 10 teams had a >1000 pt Variks Impatience penalty, and the top team had a whopping 7,350 penalty, almost 10% of their total score, but still beat the next best team by almost 15K.

If you have any questions/problems/requests/comments just comment here, msg me, or post at /r/destinychecklistnet. Thanks!

Edit: There was a problem with duped PVP entries that I fixed. Tylows on XBL is also a monster though, those aren't dupes anymore, just one player killing a lot of folks in Rift.

> Will this lose my gear or hack my account or do something else terrible?

No. All the code that touches your Bungie account for transferring gear is directly forked from Destiny Item Manager. Furthermore, all of that uses the same underlying API as Bungie.net and it blocks doing anything more serious than just transferring gear.

No. All the code that touches your Bungie account for transferring gear is directly forked from Destiny Item Manager. Furthermore, all of that uses the same underlying API as Bungie.net and it blocks doing anything more serious than just transferring gear.

I'm having one of those irritating runner's problems that doesn't seem remotely serious enough to justify a trip to a doctor but I'm completely stuck figuring out what it is (my past experience with minor athletic injuries is that I get a blank stare from the doc and advice to take some ibuprofen and perhaps a generic PT referral). I'm wondering if any of you folks might have an idea. 

If I bend over with a bent knee, I will occasionally get a tingling/burning/tearing pain in the [back of my right heel](http://imgur.com/uG7NyKz) (kinda feels like a bee sting). If I do it hard enough, it might feel a bit tender for a min or two, but then it's fine. If I do a straight leg hamstring stretch, everything is fine. If I squat down, everything is fine. It's very specifically that bending over with a mildly bent leg (the kind of movement I apparently regularly do when picking up my shoes). Running feels fine and lifting weights (including relatively heavy squat and deadlifts) also feel fine. If I remember to lift my heel when bending over, it never hurts.

This *might* have started happening after I went for a 3 mile run (which at the moment is my shortest distance) in a new pair of shoes, it's hard for me to tell. It's been around for about 10 days so far. Honestly the main thing that's bugging me about it is the simple fact that I've never felt anything like it before and can't put my finger on what it is (googling this has been less than helpful since everything REALLY wants heel pain to be plantar fasciitis). Any thoughts?

Edit: Appt with podiatrist made. I'll try to remember to update this thread if I get a useful response from the doc in case this helps anyone else.

**Final update: Good news** Podiatrist and x-ray confirmed everything is healthy, no heel spur and no Achilles issue. Turned out the Saucony Kinvara's have virtually no ""Achilles notch"" compared to my beloved Cohesions which do. It seems that even a single 4-mile run rubbed around that area enough to seriously irritated a random smaller nerve in my heel, which gets moved around when I bend over. Sticking with good shoes, and a few calf stretches are all that is needed.",What is this irritating heel pain?

Quite often those folks don't mention what exercises they're going to be doing and they almost NEVER list the weights. If I were a complete newb seeking out new gym equipment, this would lead me to the conclusion that a quality bar is a truly key component of any gym. However my personal experience as an average sized guy of relatively average strength (worst I'll probably ever do is drop a DL bar with 350 lbs on it) is that just about any Oly bar that isn't actively deformed or damaged will more than suit my needs. Knurling variances offer nice-to-have variations between bars, but it's certainly nothing critical (a $5 bag of dustless chalk will do more than a $100 bar upgrade). If I had to choose between spending $200 extra on an Oly bar that I use 5 days a week and a power drill that I use 6 times a year, I'd probably actually choose the drill.

Presumably there is some combination of weight and hard use (like dropped DL's or Oly lifts) that will really begin to stress an average bar, has anyone actually reached that? Who here has actually damaged or destroyed a bar? What kind of bar was it and how specifically did you do it?

* It probably looks like garbage if you're not running it on a widescreen monitor, I didn't do a lot of work making the layout responsive since I pretty much always use 1080 wide resolution

* It is by no means a replacement for DIM, or even the Bungie.net manager. It doesn't do loadouts or smart transfers (i.e. you move from char to vault to new char in 3 clicks), it's more useful for the once a week/month ""I need to clean out my vault"" type situation.

* It uses the underlying DIM layer for interacting with Bungie.

Never mind how I got it, but I hate how expensive it is to repair it. It's driving me crazy. It's a long boring story about a dysfunctional relationship, trust me, you it would bore you.

I want a car that I can buy in the 13K to 18K price range. I want the capability of looking up how to do small repairs on youtube and just do them myself (unlike a BMW). Or I want the ability to have an inexpensive oil change and any other kind of repair. I drive every day to and from work and everywhere else I need to go. I don't live in a city, I live in a suburban area. I would like a sedan that is good on gas. In my mind what I want is a practical car. Does any one have any suggestions?

It’s like those recipe blogs “blah blah blah story story blah blah” and at the end is the recipe. Album at the end!

Intro:


So I was browsing r/all one day and I saw a meme posted in r/mechanicalkeyboards by u/BennyKB and it was relatable on a different level. Everyone has a topic they want to talk about, but when you bring it up because it’s the only thing on your mind and the other person is like “Wow- I don’t care…” and you’re left standing there wishing there was a redo button. Naturally I check the comments for more information and people are making jokes that I don’t understand, so I keep scrolling through the comments. 

The comment that caught my eye:
Then u/soulcloset says “So true. There have been too many times that I've explained form factors to people who have never spent more than 10 dollars on a keyboard.”

My story:


I’m thinking “I’m one of those people… I’ve never spent more than $10 on a keyboard.” and u/soulcloset is making me feel like I’m missing out on something in life. Then I keep thinking about my keyboard at work and how I’ve been wanting to replace it anyways since my ex bought it for me and it has also been frustrating me lately. I work in insurance and my manager placed me in a role that requires drive and high productivity. I’m a highly productive worker, so the role really works for me. 

There are a few things holding me back and I’m constantly trying to make minor adjustments to speed things up. My keyboard doesn’t always copy things when I hit control + C and it’s highly irritating. It makes me so angry at work and sometimes I abuse my keyboard. So I spoke with Soulcloset and I told them about my keyboard habits and they recommended a keyboard that may work for me. 

The Keyboard:


Deck Hassium Pro White LED Backlit PBT Mechanical Keyboard (Red Cherry MX)

The Price:


On sale. It was $149 and I bought it for $109. If that’s a marketing trick, I fell for it. I was happy with that price either way. 


The Specs:


*Red Cherry MX Switches - I went with these switches as suggested. I didn’t want to press down hard to get a reaction from the key.  

*White LED Backlit - which I’m not excited about… I don’t like the idea of it because it’ll draw attention to it at work so I intend on not using this feature. It was just so hard to get exactly what I wanted without LED lights. 

*Double Shot PBT Keycaps - This turned out to be a bigger deal for me than I thought it would be. I was looking at a Ducky One keyboard that had double shot ABS keycaps and it was $115. Then Wooting says “In general, PBT is seen as superior over ABS keycaps, because it’s stiffer, durable (just don’t hit it with a hammer), stays true in color and doesn’t develop a shine effect over time.” and I’m thinking, why am I spending the same amount of money for an inferior product? Plus my old keyboard has gloss on the space bar it grossed me out because it just looks like oil. So PBT is a must. I couldn’t let go of the double shot feature because it made me feel like I was getting a higher quality product. I was comparing it to a Leopold FC980M at the time which was $119. 

The reasons I did not go for the Leopold FC980M was because, like I said, I could not let go of that double shot keycap feature. I thought it was too cool. Plus, ten dollars less and I got double shot keycaps. The black Leopold keyboard was also out of stock, but I could pre-order it for March 7th, but nah. 

*It’s a full keyboard since I need the number pad and arrow keys. 

Conclusion:


So that meme inadvertently opened me up to the world of Mechanical Keyboards. I had no idea it could get so specific and I did not value a high dollar keyboard before this experience. 

I just got the keyboard and I tested it out on my lap top. I love it and I can't wait to bring it into work.

My grandmother is short and mean and red headed. Not a single gray hair on her head. 

My aunt passed away September 23, 2016. She is my grandmother's daughter and she was the baby out of four and she was only 46. 

My aunt left behind her 14 year old daughter. So my cousin. Her stepdad never adopted her, so there was a custody battle between him and the real father. My aunt died suddenly of a heart attack, so she has absolutely no instructions or will or anything.

My dad makes a lot of money and hates the biological father, so he spent big money and won the step father primary custody with my parents listed as financial backers and they have co-custody in case the step dad dies. My cousin signed off on all of this and had her own lawyers. She didn't want to live with a strange man (her bio dad). 

As you can imagine, this whole drama has been mentally taxing on everyone. 

My grandmother has said some shitty things. She said she wished her nephew had died instead of her daughter. She said her daughter was better than my mother at being a mom. 

My grandmother is my mom's MIL. 

During the custody battle, she's been pissy because I think she secretly wanted custody, but everyone agreed she was too old. So she's been playing these games where she is trying to make my cousin not like my family and favor her more.

She said my dad was too corporate and couldn't be a good dad. My dad is the best father anyone could ask for, excuse the fuck out of me. He's very reasonable and all my friends love him. My husband says he's the dad he always wished he could have had. 

My grandmother is pissed because I did Big Brothers Big Sisters and ""hung out"" with my little instead of my cousin all the time. Which, my cousin has a ton of friends, plays three sports, makes great grades, had a mom who cared. My little was the opposite. No friends, didn't make good grades, mom didn't care about her and did meth- just worst scenario for this poor girl. They're jealous of all the time I spent with her, which I find ridiculous. (Tell me if I should feel otherwise- I am totally biased about this one). My little fit my busy schedule because she literally had no life outside of school.

My mom has been mean in the past, but she has worked hard at mending things. She talks to me every single night. 

The stepdad hasn't been the best. He randomly leaves the house to go hunting which leaves my cousin locked out and no where to go. He said he's only has had brothers and sons and has no idea how to raise a girl. He's not perfect or even passable, but he's the only dad my cousin has ever known. 

So my parents do a lot of the work. They buy her clothes and all necessities.


Here's the straw that broke the camels back that pissed me off. I need help on how to get through this situation and how I should respond. 

My cousin asked if my parents would host a New Year's Eve party for her and her friends. This New Year's Eve party looked cool and to be honest, I was kind of jealous - in a good way at least. I was happy for her. I wished I could have been there, but I live far away. They had a New Year's tree (just convert your Christmas tree into a New Years one by adding dollar tree decorations). It had a photo wall, necklaces, glasses- just everything. It looked cool! Her friends and boyfriend came over. 

I saw the pictures from it and assumed everything went well. Great! 

I talked to my mom today and she was upset. She said my cousin barely acknowledged her and my grandmother showed up unannounced and unexpectedly. She didn't say two words to my mom. She said hey to the dog, but not my mom. My grandmother said the New Year's Eve party would be a test. She complained to my mom a few days before how my aunt knew all of my cousin's friends and my mom didn't. My aunt would have never had a New Years tree and if my grandmother didn't know something, she would get mad and say ""no one told me!!"" As if we're supposed to report everything to her. 

I'm livid. My mom worked so hard to make that day special for my cousin and it was completely shit on. To top it off, they trashed the place. The boyfriend tried to help clean, but he had strict parents and needed to be home. Apparently he was the only nice one. All her other friends didn't even look at my mom. 

I didn't grow up this way. My friends are friends of my family. They loved my parents. I can reason that 14 years olds have bad attitudes by nature and I can forgive my cousin. I was a shitty 14 year old- most 14 year olds are not the greatest. Plus for the most part, she's a sweet girl. She just needs to be taught.

My grandmother on the other hand has killed my last nerve. I wanted to call her and chew her out. I'm sick of it. I can't stand it and I can't stand her. I didn't call her though. 

I can't help but think of how unfair this is. How can my grandmother get away with being so crummy to everyone, but I can't call her up and set her straight? How is it no one is allowed to say what they think? 

You see the problem though right? She's so involved with my cousin and my parents have co-custody. You can't just cut her off. She helped raise my cousin because my aunt worked like five jobs. 

If I called her up, the grape vine will initiate and I'll get calls from everyone. She is a drama queen. 

I want to delete her as a friend from Facebook. I'm just so mad. I want to burn the bridge. 

P.S. I can't fit all the mean things my grandmother has said without getting really off topic. 

TLDR; I can't handle how mean my grandmother is. She is so rude and disrespected my mother after my mother tried to do something nice for my cousin. ",My [26F] grandmother [78F] is disrespectful to my mother [52F]

She's a lesbian and has helped other LGBTs get through life. Her partner Lynn worked for the Red Cross for years and has helped during disasters like Katrina. They're very easy to get along with and non-judgmental. Her motto is: ""When you have the opportunity to be generous, take it.""

My aunt doesn't make a lot of money, she works in a call center and takes escalations for a big corporation. She is spiritual and happy though. She had some kidney stones removed and therefore causing an infection which spread to her blood. She kept saying how she didn't feel good after her kidney stones were removed and a former nurse who works with her told her to get medical assistance right away. She would have died if she weren't given that advice. 

Her story is on her GoFundMe page. 

I've already lost one aunt this year (Sept 2016) and an uncle (Apr 2016). I thought it wouldn't hurt to post this to Reddit to see if it would help. $5 would help- $10 would help.

Since it's a call center, it's obviously been combat situations.

This customer screamed her head off at me today and yesterday because SOMEONE ELSE put in her payment information incorrectly into the system causing it to ""return"". Her policy was in cancel status and I had to call out and let her know. I was giving her a courtesy call.

This woman berated me. Writing down what she said doesn't justify her aggression. My manager listened to the call and said it was too brutal to finish it.

He said her comments were unnecessary and she had a lot of pettiness. 

I stuck to the script and apologised and I didn't say anything special. I just went quiet when she got ridiculous, because honestly, it was going to be like arguing with an idiot. 

(If you need the conclusion, she paid in full for both policies...)

You could tell she was a narcissist. She had a comment for every little thing I did. She kept telling me I couldn't do my job, I couldn't do anything right, I was stupid, I took up her time. Just think: abusive to orphans like they are in the movies. Like that. She was a nightmare. She berated me the whole time.

The whole reason I didn't really get upset was because the situation was obviously not my fault and I know I do a great job. It was more confusing than insulting. She was like ""I just can't believe you people! Always messing everything up!!""

It was her first policy with us and it just started. Literally no time has passed and there hasn't even been time for error.

So yeah- I'm more confused than upset. 

Anyways, my manager told me not to let people talk to me that way. He said I need more ""fight"". 

How do I learn this? What can I do to be more assertive or give more push back?

She's a first generation college student from Honduras. She reminds me a lot of myself at her age, because I was a first generation college student once upon a time, I had uneducated parents, I was flirty. At her age I wanted to adopt all homeless children and make them a high class shelter to help them get adopted (she has the exact same dream which I found funny. I didn't tell her I had that dream because I don't want to discourage her). But guys usually respond well to her. She gets ""guy friends"" all the time who even up having feelings for her. She's that type of girl. Same type I was at her age, but I grew up and moved on and all that good stuff. 

She gets flirty with my husband, which I don't even see as a threat because I am aware that she probably doesn't mean it that way. It's childish too, like arm punches or something. I did the same thing at her age because men responded well to it. I learned over time that it was immature and not everyone likes it. 

Anyways, my husband hates it. It irritates him and he doesn't like her touching him at all. Not even in a friendly way, not arm punches. And today she came by our desks (we work together, she works with us in a different department) and she pulled out the picture from our wedding where my husband was so overwhelmed with happiness that he was crying with his father. She kind of made fun of him for it- for crying. I didn't hear it, but I imagine it is your typical ""ha ha grown man crying"" banter. 

My husband gets sensitive about things. After she walked off he came over to my desk to express how pissed he was. I see it as all in good fun, but it bothers him to the point where the next time he may snap at her. Which obviously is not a good thing. He says he's been trying to keep his cool because it's my friend, but he's had enough. 

Now- I'm not my friend's mom. But this is bothering my husband. What do i do? I can't sit her down and teach her about respect and professionalism in the office, like I said, I'm not her mom. It was a lessons I learned the hard way myself (at a much younger age than her). 

My husband says ""don't say anything to her"" because he doesn't want the friction.

What do I do? 

TLDR; older husband is annoyed/irritated by younger friend who hasn't figured out not everyone likes friendly flirting yet. I'm not her mom, but this bothers my husband. How should I go about this? 

UPDATE: I spoke to my husband tonight. I apologized for not taking it seriously and I've decided to talk to my friend about this. A lot of people pointed out the double standard (like you wouldn't like it done to you) and that's true. I see the double standard. I was going to wait for her to grow out of it, but she's crossed some boundaries. Thanks for the help!

So this supervisor is very sassy to begin with. He's black and gay and loves fruit snacks. His race was the only relevant feature to this story. 

This guy from Kentucky is screaming at my supervisor and my supervisor talks back. 

All you hear is ""you're not going to tell me to shut up if you want me to help you.... No, I'm telling you how to talk to me, because I'm trying to help you.... So that's how you do business?... You want me to suck your cock?... Yes I am a N*****..... When you call you back you'll get another N*****.... You're surprised that I'm talking back to you this way? It's 2016, get over yourself! Now I'm hanging up""


That's the short version. I work in the commercial department, this guy owns a business. 

This almost made me cry and I didn't even handle the call, that's how brutal it was. What the hell kind of person speaks this way?? 

The supervisor just calmly walked away. He wasn't bothered by it at all. He messaged me and said ""that wasn't even the worst phone call I've ever had lol""

You want to know the truth? If your insurance company raises your rate above 20%, they don't want you any more and they're trying to nudge you out because you're too risky or there have been a lot of losses associated with your type of business. But I can't say that. 

I literally have to make up stuff or just insist that it is a rate increase. Obviously no body likes that answer. I'm frustrated with my company for not growing a pair and saying ""you are no longer preferred due to: blah blah blah. Please find insurance else where"" aka non-renew.

I'm frustrated with the customers because there's literally nothing I can do about it unless you want terrible coverage. 

Plus, I don't call up insurance companies asking why the raised the rates because I know why. They're a company that wants more money, simple as that. I would simply shop around and switch. It's not a big deal.

So this lady need to reinstate her policy because we non-renewed it. So after it expires, no more insurance for her. So I'm trying to work with her and I'm trying to get the required information for the underwriter, because I believe I could actually reinstate her. The last thing the underwriter needed was this simple question ""Who owns the building and what entity is it?""

No. She couldn't just answer that question. She went off on me and volunteered information that I didn't ask for, such as ""There's nothing even in that building since I bought it last year! It's empty!!"" That's something I would usually overlook, but after I heard the word ""estupid"" (spanish call, I had an interpreter) I said ""you know, I didn't realize that the building was vacant. We do not insure vacant buildings and we cannot renew you at this time"" you could tell she was regretting being rude to me. 

But uhh... technically that is true. We do not insure vacant buildings. We didn't know it was vacant and we didn't really ask, but if she wants to volunteer that information instead of simply answering ""who owns that building"" then uh... screw her. 

It's it's not like she was rude only once. She was condescending the whole phone call. I kept asking to make sure she meant to say certain things. Then after a while, I got tired of dealing with her. 

Sorry dude. 

For the record, I turned someone's $700 collection notice into a $108 refund because 1) the customer was nice and patient and allowed to me investigate the situation. Her mannerism allowed to to calmly look at all the details and realize that technically, we owed her money instead. So I'm not a bad guy. 

It's not like non-renewing that lady would make me feel better, obviously since it's been two hours since I've been at work and I tried to find a subreddit for this.

It's something I've been debating about for 5 years. I've read so many stories (including the ones on this sub), I've read so many articles, I've picked up non-verbal ques from other parents. 

I will say that people do love their kids, but I think it's not for me. I love kids, they're cute. I just don't want to LIVE with one. 

I spoke about it with my fiance [33M] today and he was happy with the decision. We talked about all the things we could accomplish ourselves without kids.

I told him one of the reasons I did want a kid was because I wanted to put an interesting person in the world. I wanted to fully educate the kid and entertain its hobbies. I only had thought about one kid, so I could put all of my money into it. When I told him that was one of the reasons, he said we can make ourselves interesting. I liked that thought. Plus I wouldn't be trying to control someone else's life and trying to impose education on them. I could willfully study what ever I wanted and make myself interesting. I could pay to take myself to college (I already have a degree in finance, but I realized too late that I don't want to work in finance). 

We could travel. We talked about getting a dog instead (later- like 10 years later). 

I was telling him how we were both laying in bed this morning and cuddling, that couldn't happen if we had a kid. 

I felt like a lot of pressure had been lifted off of me. I felt relieved, because I was trying to calculate how a kid was going to fit into my life and when I should have one. I kept pushing back the age to a point where I would be too old to have one. I feel amazing and motivated and I also feel like I have some hope to better myself instead of making another person and starting all over. 

Plus the idea of being pregnant grosses me out. I don't want to stretch myself like that, it doesn't seem pleasant. Plus all of these parents are trying to over compensate for their decision to have a child, for example ""These stretch marks are beautiful and I'm a mom"". I'm trying to read between the lines thinking ""I don't think you actually believe that"". 

I think all of this stemmed from the fact that I got my passport yesterday and all the sudden I feel like I have the keys to the world and anything is possible. Again, this is something that has been weighing on me for five years. I've read so much about it. How kids negatively effect your marriage and such. I love my fiance so much, I'm so happy with him. I don't want to ruin that. 

I feel like cleaning and being a productive adult now. I don't feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle (financially or mentally). I feel so great. 

I don't think I'll tell my parents... my dad will understand, my mom won't. My dad always says ""young people are deciding not to have kids"". My mom will freak out. His parents will freak out. (Context: I love my dad to death. He is my favorite person. My mom, to keep it short, not so much. His parents are cool and I love them). 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just have so much to say!

TLDR; I've decided to be CF and I'm so excited about it! 

Edit: thank you so much for the stories and support. It has helped me feel like my decision was the right one and that's hard to find offline (besides in my own home). Thank you ",I've decided to be CF

So I wondered if coconut oil could help me internally. I looked into it and apparently women with vaginal dryness use it as a lubricant. 

So I've been using coconut oil. It's amazing. My pain goes away quicker and I feel like I'm healing. It's nothing I've ever considered before and I wanted to share it with this community. 

Other things I've tried: going to a doctor with an ivy league education. A big contributing factor to my vaginismus was a fungal infection (not bacterial). It took a great doctor to figure that out. She also knew about vaginismus. If you have this issue, get the best of the best. Any one else can go to any doctor and be fine. This is a special condition though and if you want to live a normal life, you'll need the top doctor in town that has an ivy league degree.

What: we got into an argument.

Why: She kept talking bad about my brother in front of me constantly and using me to pry into his personal life. They would also argue in front of me and it was super awkward. One day she made my brother so upset, he was crying profusely and ran into the house screaming. This scared me and it was also the last straw. I only ever see my brother this upset in the worst situations. So I told her off. Was it the most mature thing to do? Probably not.   

What did they argue over? I honestly have no idea. I can't remember, because it's been so long and I have moved on. 

So. My parents confronted me last night and said they usually wouldn't care, but this girl will potentially be apart of our family this summer. 

My parents know the full story. They told me that she's still ""butt hurt"" over the whole thing. It's been two years and I have long since let it go and forgave and have forgotten. Until now. This has reopened the wound. 

I feel hurt. My brother has stopped talking to me because of it. 

I'm hurt because I know I would never do this to my brother. I have been known to break up with guys who didn't get along with my family anyways. It really hurts that he wouldn't do the same for me. I hurts that I'm going to have to be the bigger person and apologize for something that I'm still not sorry for. 

I feel like I should apologize to her anyways. I don't want this drama in the family. I didn't think very highly of his girl friend to begin with, but my thoughts of her have dropped even lower now. She's held a grudge for this long over what? 

I'm hurt because I have higher expectations for myself. For example, I don't like my boyfriend's sister. Not at all, she's obnoxious and inconsiderate. She's even stolen stuff from me. But I let it go, because it's just stuff and honestly if she just asked I would have let her have it. She doesn't even know I don't like her. She's my facebook friend she and likes every single picture I ever post and tells me how she favors me out of all the other girls he's ever dated. I try really hard to maintain a positive relationship with his family. Even if the sister and I got into an argument, I can't even imagine myself driving a wedge between my boyfriend and his sister. That is completely out of the question. I have strict rules about everything. Under no circumstances, no matter how upset I am, will i ever argue with my boyfriend in front of every body. I don't talk bad about him and I don't even share our problems unless I am super close to that person, because I don't want my friends to hate him over a stupid argument him and I have. 

So you can see what kind of person I am. Am I perfect? No, that's not what I'm trying to say. Not at all. I shouldn't have even told this girl off to begin with, because here I am 2-3 frickin years later paying for it. I should have stayed out of their business. It's too late for should-have, could-have's now. 

What I want to get out of this thread: 

I want one of the following things:

1. Someone help me figure out how to apologize to this witch. It will be through email since I live so far from her. I have no idea what to even say. The apologizes I've come up with aren't real.

2. If you want to talk about how much of a douche she is- that would make me feel better. If you're that kind of person, go for it. If you're not that kind of person, hopefully you won't judge me or lecture me on it. I know it's bad, but I did say I wasn't perfect. 

3. If you have some kind of perceptive I should be looking at. Maybe if you had a different angle on this. 

4. Support or advise. 

Thanks.

You don't need to, [take a look at this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

Notice how the upvotes there are completely different from what you'd see today.

And here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40ppt9/censored_front_page_thread_about_bitcoin_classic/?sort=top

The mod that un-removed the post after Theymos removed it was removed as a mod that same day.  Notice the ?sort=top in the link there?  Threads are always sorted by top by default.  But moderators can change the default sort for threads, so what did /r/Bitcoin do?  *Sort by controversial by default on certain threads only to push down opinions they didn't like*.  Remove the ?sort=top part and reload the page to see exactly what I mean and how it changes the discussion.

That was then, how about now?  People get banned literally just for [saying they support 2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72s0h0/thought_that_the_whole_got_banned_from_rbitcoin/).

So what happened to change /r/Bitcoin so drastically?  Well I can't prove this, but here's the graphs that show my theory.  If you look here, the subscriber growth of /r/Bitcoin [was pretty low for all of 2016](http://redditmetrics.com/r/Bitcoin) - Sept 2015 to Jan 2017 = 172k to 200k(+16%), lower even than the [raw growth of Reddit](http://redditmetrics.com/r/AskReddit), 9.5m to 14.9m(+57%), and remember... that counts dead & throwaway accounts.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Crypto more than doubled in size - [110k transactions per day Sept 2015, 260k transactions per day January 2017](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?daysAverageString=30&timespan=all) - +136%.  And Bitcoin/Crypto [quadrupled in price/market cap](https://imgur.com/9jnkXIu), +251%.

In other words, while Bitcoin itself more than doubled in size, /r/Bitcoin actually *shrank significantly* compared to Reddit's growth.  Why?  Because for every new person who joined /r/Bitcoin, more than one person left.  Where did they all go?  Well some went to /r/btc, but not nearly enough to account for the missing ~350k subscribers that Reddit+bitcoin growth would predict.  But where did they go then?

To other Crypto-Currencies.  The developers went to build them, everyone else invested and promoted.  Mr. Market is slow, but Mr. Market always sees everything, and [he caught up when the Bitcoin scaling issue really slammed into the ceiling](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DALFglbUMAAEre6.jpg:large).

/r/Bitcoin literally got rid of all of the people who disagreed, exactly like Theymos wanted in that first link above: 

> *""If 90% of /r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of /r/Bitcoin users to leave.""*

And Theymos did, in fact, change the direction of Bitcoin singlehandedly, [exactly as he said he would do](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3l6oni/theymos_i_know_how_moderation_affects_people/) when confronted in 2015:

I thought more people could benefit from this explanation.  Obviously, some people here will disagree with my explanation, which is fine.  Glad to be somewhere where real discussions and debate can happen.

>  It is my understanding the way segwit works is it's a layer for transactions to occur off chain (run by a centralized server/system) and then big swaths of transactions are moved on Bitcoin as a kind of settlement layer at the end of the day or whatever.

Oiy, no.  Sorry, not trying to be rude, there's a lot of misinformation that is spread and to be honest, this stuff is kind of hard to actually understand even **without** the misinformation.  I'm going to go ahead and correct a bunch of different pieces of misinformation that are common and then cover your specific example.  I'm skipping over some things and simplifying some things; let me know if you want more detail.

So Segwit itself isn't actually a layer of anything.  Transactions are normally composed of the following: 

1. <input_location> <input_signature_data>
2. (1 is repeated N times for N inputs)
3. <output_amount> <output_signature_requirements>
4. (3 is repeated M times for M outputs)

You can see this in action in this random transaction I picked: https://blockchain.info/tx/c1379ab4aeb2a3f4899a52f0d75466ae07760d0f7601de557e9ff568294c2b81

It has 5 inputs and 2 outputs.  If you scroll down, blockchain.info lists the signature data for inputs under ""Input Scripts"" and it lists the signature data for outputs under ""Output Scripts"".  You don't need to understand it, just see what I mean.  There's also a tiny bit more data that I'm ignoring for brevity(lol, brevity).  Also notice how much larger the text on each ""inputs"" section is than the ""outputs"" section; The input section takes up a lot more bytes of space.

There has always been one type of transaction in Bitcoin that did not require an input script: the ""anyone-can-spend"" transaction type.  So long as the output is of that anyone-can-spend type, all modern versions of the software would accept that input without a signature.

What segwit does fundamentally is that it takes the <input_signature_data> blocks, which are by far the largest part of most transactions, and moves them to a new location called the witness data block.  So now it looks like this:

1. <input_location> ~~<REMOVED>~~
2. (1 is repeated N times for N inputs)
3. <output_amount> <output_signature_requirements>
4. (3 is repeated M times for M outputs)

Witness data section:

1. <input_signature_data>

Splitting the input signature data out of the transaction is the most common solution to the transaction malleability problem, which I'll cover more in a moment.  Despite what is commonly repeated here in /r/btc, this signature data is still present and is still required.  Also despite what used to be commonly repeated here in /r/btc, segwit transactions can't be stolen via the ""anyone-can-spend"" rules as Segwit actually changed the meaning of the rule and reverting that would require the same things as any other attempt to steal coins.  This rule change is how Segwit could be done as a soft fork (which I personally believe it absolutely should not have been, but that's neither here nor there).

So as you can see, this simply changes the structure of the transaction.  This moved information still winds up hashed into the header (through the miner's block reward transaction) so the ""chain of signatures"" of Bitcoin is still preserved.  Now, how does all of this relate back to the 2nd layer and settlement layer stuff?

Great question, bear with me, I know this is long.  Blockstream has hired or has close ties with the majority of Bitcoin Core developers, and they have two products that create a ""layer 2"" of Bitcoin, though only one of those seems like it could make a profit for them.  Liquid I know little about but it seems like mostly vaporware thus far.  Lightning is the one everyone talks about.

Lightning relies on Bitcoin's multiple-signer transactions to create a system where two people can trade money back and forth as many times as they want without putting money at risk of theft by either party.  Basically, both parties lock up x and y BTC inside multi-sig transactions and trade signatures back and forth as they exchange money; At any given moment someone can send their latest multi-sig-transaction and get the money that the other party last agreed they had back.  All of this can be done without segwit at all; Segwit simply makes the process better, easier, and more powerful by fixing the issue known as transaction malleability, and most solutions for transaction malleability require that the signature data is separated from the transaction anyway.  Lightning is a system of interlocking those channels between two people to connect everyone else indirectly.  All in all, it is fairly clever, but has numerous issues and limitations as well.

So Segwit, itself, is not a layer of anything, it is just a change to transaction structures and the definitions of opcodes.  And it doesn't run anything offchain that couldn't be done anyway.

So where did that idea come from?  The answer is a little more complex, but it goes back to the people who created Segwit and Lightning, and how Segwit came about to begin with.  Many people have known for a long time that the Bitcoin blocksize limit was going to be reached and needed to be raised.  However, raising that limit means that running a Bitcoin full node will cost more in terms of storage, CPU, and bandwidth.  The pro-core group of people have convinced themselves that running a full node is the only way to ensure that Bitcoin doesn't get taken over by corporations or governments, and they are convinced that miners are likely already compromised and therefore working against Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin Core developer group heavily subscribes to this view.  In 2015 the scaling debate was raging between the Bitcoin developers who wanted Bitcoin to scale with a blocksize increase and those who didn't.  The contingent opposed has remained basically the same; In 2013 Peter Todd stated he wanted to avoid even the precedent of a successful blocksize increase.  Luke-Jr wants to decrease the blocksize.  Maxwell said he thinks that the blocksize should never be increased.  Most of the other core developers are moderate in that they state it should be increased ""at some point"" with substantial planning and consensus, but they have taken zero steps to lay out that planning or a timeline of any sort other than segwit; Their actions put a lie to their words.

Segwit itself came about only after BitcoinXT threatened to split off.  The core developers created a series of ""scaling Bitcoin"" conferences at which no concrete plan proposals were allowed to be discussed, and proposed Segwit as a way to increase the blocksize without establishing the precedent of a successful hardfork increase.  The core developers who actually wanted to increase the blocksize were attacked and smeared incessantly, and all of them quit or moved on.  Core also created a conference where they signed an agreement to torpedo Bitcoin Classic(another even smaller hardfork proposal) and then reneged on the agreement.

The Core developers see (and want) a future of high on-chain fees that force users to use layer-2 solutions like Lightning.  The author of Lightning said fees will be over $1000 on-chain and that's just fine with him.  Segwit is a piece of that journey simply because it a) contributes to the illusion that Core actually wants Bitcoin to scale which is essential for the brainwashed masses in censorship-land, b) it was an acceptable compromise between the most anti-increase members of Core and the moderate members of Core, and c) it enables some additional features of Lightning and other layer 2 solutions through its malleability fix and versioning additions.

The second layer stuff is where potential centralization creeps in.  I don't know about Liquid, but Lightning is in theory decentralized, but in practice it is very unlikely to be because it creates numerous trade-offs that encourage users to congregate around hubs, and those hubs become the centralized vulnerability that Bitcoin was supposed to avoid.  Ironically despite Core's fears about node costs and mining centralization, Ethereum has scaled farther than Bitcoin for less cost, with more full nodes, AND less miner centralization.

tl;dr:

1. Segwit changes the transaction structure around, it isn't 2nd layer or centralized
2. 2nd layer can exist without segwit; segwit makes it better by providing an ""optional"" malleability fix
3. Neither segwit nor 2nd layer are inherently evil;
4. The bad part comes because Core wants to **force** everyone to use the second layer through excessive fees.
5. 2nd layer is likely to become centralized and allow Blockstream to profit from their takeover of development.

I've seen a lot of people advocating for 2x to fail to give BCC a boost.  Stop and think - When you advocate that, you are literally taking the same side as Core + Theymos.  Why would they and you advocate the same things?

Because they have the ecosystem.  If they can kill of 2x, they keep most of the ecosystem and Cash has to build from scratch.  The median over the last 7 days was 10k BCC transactions per day.  Ethereum was over 350k, Bitcoin was ~280k.  Those numbers are not in the same ball park.  Yes, the price is rising and so are transactions, and actually that gives me a lot of hope I never really had for BCH before, but you can't lose sight of the cold hard reality.

The markets don't decide on philosophy.  That's why we want the markets to make these decisions, not programmers in basements or trolls on the internet.  But if the only two options that I(and others) have is between SmallBlockExtremistCoin and BigBlockExtremistCoin and the big blocks doesn't have the ecosystem built by Bitpay, Coinbase, and 7 years of our hard work?  I'm not going to choose either, because those aren't the only two choices I have.

Yes, if 2x died it would be a boost to BCH, and I get it - many of you are heavily invested in BCH and have little in BTC now.  But shake the fog from your eyes and look at the bigger picture.

If you want 2x to die prematurely, you're not only advocating the same things as Theymos, Maxwell, Todd, BashCo, and Luke-Jr, you're guaranteeing that /r/btc remains the minority sub for the forseeable future and that the small blockers still have a seat at the table - maybe even the most seats.  Imagine if 2x succeeds and Core forks for a PoW change.  Here's what we'd get:

1. The Core Devs will fragment because few of them are willing to be that extreme and push the minority chain.  While they may have some shit theories about economics, many of them have very valuable experience and knowledge regarding Bitcoin's code and cryptography.  The fragments will shift to BCC and 2x.  Maxwell, Todd, and Luke will either stick with tinyCoin or quit entirely.
2. All the smallblockers will sell their BCC and BTC to prop up their minority fork.  The winning fork of the three will successfully reduce the influence of *ALL OTHER EXTREMISTS*.  Meaning... No more small blocker influence on Bitcoin, **ever**, *because they won't own any*.
3. /r/btc will become the *de-facto primary forum and source of information for Bitcoin*.  /r/bitcoin will be dedicated to tinyCoin fork.

If 2x were to fail prematurely, BCH would get a small boost, but the small blockers would **still own bitcoin** and **still continue to control and trash the ecosystem**.

Now think about it.  Who are your true allies?  Is it Garzik, Andresen, Bitpay, Coinbase, Bitmain, Jihan, and Roger?  Or is it Theymos, Maxwell, Todd, BashCo, and Luke-Jr?

What was Theymos' stunt today regarding BitPay and bitcoin.org REALLY about?  Bitpay isn't going to be affected, they probably get almost no traffic and no customers from bitcoin.org anymore.  They're huge.  Theymos' stunt on bitcoin.org wasn't about BitPay, it was a message to *all of the smaller businesses* who get a non-trivial influx of new customers from Core/Theymos-controlled websites.  And small businesses may not be able to afford to stand up to Theymos' garbage the way BitPay and Coinbase can.

If 2x is going to fail, let it fail in free competition.  2x and BCC are on the same side of this war.  We have a different idea about how to get to the goal, but we have the same end goals.  Never forget your allies.  No one makes a deal with the devil and walks away the winner.",2x vs Cash... Did you forget who the enemy is? Do you know what happens when you make a deal with the devil?

If we drive people out and don't encourage real discussion and debate that can change people's minds, are we really any better than /r/bitcoin and Core?

Here's what we can do.  Try not to use downvotes to vote against well-reasoned and evidence-backed arguments.  If someone is legitimately trying to debate reasonably, upvote them even if you disagree.  If our ideas can't stand on their own in the face of real debate, we need to fix our ideas.  You can even reply to state that you don't agree, but are upvoting solely because the argument is well written and cites real data or evidence.

Similarly, if you see someone getting downvoted to an extreme, even if it isn't a great comment, upvote it to balance them out.  Downvotes beyond -10 don't really do anything, and they make it very difficult for the user to keep positive karma so they can *actually comment*.

Lastly, if you see shitty behavior by people, even people we agree with, call it out and remind them that we need to be better than our enemies.  Do it politely and even empathise with their frustration, but do ask them to tone it down.

We win by being better and by having ideas that both withstand real debate, as well as being able to debate and demonstrate flaws in opposing ideas.  For the forseeable future we're all in this together, whether we like eachother or not.

Even recently, you could find in my post history that I was strongly opposed to them, and I worked out a lot of math to back that position.

No longer.  I am changing my position and now support larger blocksizes, however that is accomplished.  The reasons for this are complicated, but I wanted to spell them out - and the math - for anyone else who has an open mind.

There are two core reasons, in my mind, why large blocksizes could be a problem:

1. Tragedy-of-the-commons threats to Bitcoin's security and/or decentralization.
2. Resource costs for node operators.

The first step was that I needed to look at enough numbers to assure myself that Bitcoin will not find itself vulnerable in the future.  In the past I spelled out an attack vector whereby a determined short seller could 51% attack Bitcoin and turn a profit, at any price point.  After looking at the numbers and estimates in depth, I am now convinced that we will never be in significant danger of that, unless many transactions begin to expect to pay zero fees or fees lower than $0.25 per transaction (irregardless of Bitcoin price).

But whether I adjusted the blocksize growth to match transaction trends, or whether I adjusted blocksize growth to be very conservative(or locked at 1mb), the fees required to protect us seem to be reached in time.  Thus, while we do need a fee market, I now believe that it will become a non-issue.

The trade-off of this, of course, is that transaction fees will never be below a certain amount either.  Based on our current growth, I estimated this as ranging between $0.20 to $1.50 per transaction as a minimum to keep Bitcoin protected, depending highly upon what nodes choose in response to the next question.

The clincher was resource consumption, part 2 above.  I reject the philosophy by many people that reductions in hard drive costs and bandwidth costs will make Bitcoin viable at any scale, and I haven't seen any convincing evidence that algorithmic improvements will magically fix the problem either.  I also discovered that if Bitcoin doesn't establish some sort of history checkpointing, the bandwidth costs are going to eat us alive due to the syncing of new nodes, and soon(1.5 TB a month TODAY on default bitcoind settings; <100 GB/mo today if you reduce node counts and/or people don't sync from you).

The realization I had is that there's an inverse relationship between the blocksize(and corresponding fee levels) and the usefulness of a home user operating a node.  In other words, who cares how much it costs to run a Bitcoin node if you can't send at least 150 transactions in a year for that same amount of money.  Re-said again, if Bitcoin price growth trends hold, no one will give a fuck if home users can't run nodes anymore.  Wealthy early adopters, tech-related charities, small & large businesses, and miners will pick up the slack when the home users stop running nodes due to the costs.

I worked this out into math - For any given year, Bitcoin price, or storage/bandwidth prices, and blocksizes, how many BTC does it cost to operate a node for a year?  Today that number works out to about 0.1 BTC (~$14 of a hard drive, $6 a month of bandwidth on AWS).  That seems pretty reasonable to me - 0.1 BTC to run a node every year.  So when I extrapolated that from our transaction growth, I found that the per-BTC costs to run a node increase (slightly) for the next few years if we don't cap transactions.  If our growth continues on its insane pace(80%/year) and price increases grow much slower(44%/y avg), by 2033 it would cost 0.70 BTC to run a node for 1 year ($190,000 with those assumptions!!).  Definitely a bit steep... Except that in order to hit those numbers, Bitcoin by that year would be taking up nearly 45% of the world's transaction volume by that point!

We will, of course, need improvements on client non-validating software and trustworthy client validating services.  But in so many words... I was wrong before, and I apologize to the people I argued with.  While I still don't think we can support ALL the crazy growth that Bitcoin has done over the last few years, and I don't think that Bitcoin can support any use case that requires fees to be less than $0.50 per transaction long-term, I do believe that we can keep fees from rising much higher than that.

Now, as far as how, exactly, to accomplish a blocksize increase... That is a hard problem.  I don't think there is a way to get the perfect answer.  The perfect blocksize for a given resource consumption level is a function of the technology(which can be approximated for short periods but not long ones), and also a function of the Bitcoin price(an unknown/unknowable for future predictions).  The reason I say it is a function of the price goes back to the inverse relationship between the low usability of Bitcoin for its most cash-strapped node operators.  Since we can't calculate the perfect blocksize growth rates, I began reading up on BU, as well as other proposals.  While I think it is pretty abhorrent how the BU crowd has been acting, I do think their proposal might be ""good enough"" if it was accompanied by Segwit, which will even out bandwidth needs, fix malleability, and enable lightning in addition.

If anyone has any questions or wants me to use some estimates, I can do those with the spreadsheet I've made.  If someone wanted to clean it up and upload it somewhere they can, but it is a beast with 23 columns and 13 variables, and probably hard to read/navigate.",The math on why I now support larger blocks.

Hey Zane,

Here's some suggestions / requests that I think would ease most people's minds about this socialized loss.  I know that you can't (or shouldn't) personally have / be able to release this information, but you could take this case to the leadership for approval and be our voice.  Also I know that this takes significant time, time that you guys don't have right now to be hunting this all down, so instead simply give us a future date by when this information will be available, like 30 days out.

Sharing this information will benefit Bitfinex in the end for a few reasons:

1. If Bitfinex does transition the loss tokens to iFinex ownership shares, which some users will demand, Bitfinex will have a moral and legal obligation to share this information in audited form like any other public company anyway.
2. Some users will sue Bitfinex no matter what you do(likely the ones with no realistic understanding of how much the lawsuits will cost).  Going above and beyond with the openness will position any judges or juries to be favorable towards Bitfinex while discouraging lawsuits in general.
3. In order for Bitfinex to repay these losses, Bitfinex must make a profit.  In order to make a profit they must have regular users, new and old, and in order to have that they must have trust.  I've gained a lot of respect for Bitfinex because of what you've shared so far; For that respect to continue and for me to use Bitfinex in the future, I would personally need answers to most of the below and I assume others would as well.
4. If users have a decision to make regarding whether to transition their loss tokens or whether to be repaid as a loan, Bitfinex would be legally and morally required to provide public-company type financial documents so they could make an informed decision.

These are some of the things that I think Bitfinex needs to share, which you would need approval from the leadership to find/organize/share:

1. What were Bitfinex's total profit/loss since inception?  This can/should include any expenses in creating software, in getting approvals, legal counsel expenses, and losses eaten in previous hacks.  I would expect a loss for several years, but this information may help dampen the fires and also set expectations.
2. What is the current equity ownership division of Bitfinex?  What are the outstanding debt obligations and to whom?  What owners of the company are not or have not been actively working for the company day-to-day?
3. What countries laws would Bitfinex be following with regards to protecting minority shareholder interests?
4. Of profits earned thus far, what % were paid out and to whom?
5. What were the details of the calculations that lead to 36.067% losses?  What portion of that loss represents Bitfinex's working capital / past profits?  Was any non-Bitfinex outside owner money added to that and if so what percentage did it represent?  Were any loans or other infusions included in those calculations?
6. What is Bitfinex's current monthly payroll outlays for employees with no equity, and how many employees?  What about for employees who own less than 5% equity and number?  What about for employees/owners with more than 5% equity and number?
7. What are the estimated legal costs of defending Bitfinex from lawsuits arising from this situation(* Note I know this number will be, at best, a wild guess, but the lawyer should be able to give a range)?  Are their any regular outside contractors with substantial monthly outlays?  Does anyone have any existing claims to Bitfinex profits prior to dividend payout calculation?
8. Bitfinex should publish a thorough post-mortem of the technical information from the hack as well as lessons learned, root cause, and corrective actions(& due date for corrective actions not yet completed).  Bitfinex should publish any information it can about the investigation into the theft, though much must be withheld at the authorities request.  The authorities would probably not restrict any technical post-mortem information.  Any withheld investigation information should be given a future date when it will be released, 1-4 years hence.  If there's important post-mortem details that can't be shared without endangering live systems, a third party security expert should review that and summarize their own findings and corrections/root causes without revealing those details.
9. To satisfy extreme skeptics, some level of this information will need to be verified by an outside auditor, probably P&L and payroll outlays.
10. I'm not sure how you would do this, but proving that there was a hacker and that this was not an inside job would help with the number of angry skeptics out there.  That's a big reason why the investigation & post-mortem information is so important to share.

I know this is asking a lot; If management objects, please relay this: They have decided that it is better to put the users and Bitfinex on the same ship and either sink or swim together.  It is a good decision, and some rough math indicates that it'll probably work out in everyone's favor, but it is also a two way street- The users need confidence and trust now, something not easily given.  Without that confidence, Bitfinex will sink and everyone will lose.  Without users' trusts, future profits will never materialize and lawsuits will drown the company and affect the employees and owners for years to come.

If it became mandatory in the U.S. it would be as disastrous as everyone is fearing.

As far as I can tell, the anonmyizing steps that Luke-jr and coinjoin have suggested will help, but not resolve the issue.  There's only three ways to stop this from happening.

1. We fight tooth and nail to prevent this from happening until Bitcoin is already too strong for it to be a threat.  This would mean we would have to delay it for at least 2-3 years.  This fighting is already happening(hence the anger directed towards Yufi), but it is unlikely to be successful.  If Yufi doesn't do it, someone else will.

2. We globalize Bitcoin before the Coinvalidation process can take hold.  In a truly global economy, having coins locked out of the U.S. would have a fairly small impact on their value, as they would just be spent elsewhere and not need to enter any official U.S. gateways.  This means we need a *lot* of Bitcoin businesses starting up outside the U.S.

3. We create many many competing coinvalidation services, all with *different* rules and jurisdictions.  So long as these services don't agree and one of them doesn't gain a global / U.S. monopoly, the government will be forced to make difficult or impossible compromises on which one to follow.  This would have the desired affect of applying morality in shades of grey as well as regionally.  We would need one service that only redlists addresses used by known and verified Bitcoin scammers.  Another that only redlists coins that are used by those committing crimes against humanity.  Another that only redlists crimes as defined by the chinese government.  If we have many competing ones created before the U.S. government gets to define what this means, it'll completely destroy the value of what the U.S. government tries to define.

Does anyone know if there is legal precedent for this?  What was the legal justification for shutting down liberty dollars and other 'currencies' in the U.S. in the past?

Could they make it illegal for U.S. based websites to accept bitcoin as currency?

Edit: To be clear, it is the exchanges, the investors, and the merchants I am concerned with.  They obviously can't shut it down.

Edit2: It looks like these are the statutes that liberty dollar was shut down under: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/514 and http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/486

Clearly the second doesn't apply in this case; bitcoin is not backed by or related to gold.  The first is sketchy-

    States, a foreign government, a State or other political subdivision of the United States, or an

Edit3: More: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/485 - It does have a resemblance to a coin.  The physical coins that people bought could definitely fall under that, but an image I doubt could.

It is not some massive shift in the world of Bitcoin.  It is not MtGox's fault.  It is not the high frequency traders fault.  It is not even the speculators fault.  Merchant acceptance will not save us from these things.

We are dealing with a massive new technology that has the potential to change *everything.*  It will change how money is transferred between countries.  It could become the international standard among currency evaluation.  It will change how the drug/black market operates.  It will change how Governments regulate borders.  This is not a speculative stock.  This is not a currency useful for day-to-day trading.  You cannot be a ""bitcoin millionaire"" without knowing that if the network got cracked, you'd be worth $0 in minutes.

We have a long, long way to go yet.  In order for the above things to happen(and they WILL happen, even if bitcoin gets cracked or made illegal- something else will replace Bitcoin), the market size of Bitcoin needs to increase.

1. $50k - Early adopters will push it up($0.01->$0.20).
2. $1 million - People will start using it for small transactions(silk road).
3. $50 million - Small time illegal activity will flow through it, and people will start to use it to transfer money across borders(See; Argentina post recently).
4. $1 billion - Mid-level illegal transactions and mid-sized legal transactions will flow through it.  Angel and VC Investors(200k - 5 million) will move in in increasing size will both invest and create startups(happening now; **this is the step we are on.** *We will never go back to step 3 unless the Bitcoin network itself is cracked*).
5. $25 billion - Higher level illegal transactions(mob bosses) and larger investors(multi-million sized) start to move in.  Governments start to get involved, try to regulate what they can, and create rules for the system.  High net worth individuals use it for international currency transfers.
6. $400 billion - After that, large businesses & investors move in.  Becomes the de-facto standard for illegal activity.  Government regulation cracks down and becomes more rigid.  Some(A few) Bitcoin businesses are shut down by the Government without warning, prompting fear and anger.  Small companies regularly use it for international currency transfers.
7. $1 trillion - After that, International currency movements start to flow through it.  Very large investors move in, it is talked about as if it were standardized and common.  Businesses learn to follow Government rules and procedures become standardized.  Large businesses use it to transfer currencies internationally.
8. $5-20 trillion - Becomes the de-facto standard of international trade and currency evaluation, replacing the dollar as the global standard.  Prices stabilize and shift only a fraction of a percent a day.  **Can now be used as a real currency for the first time since inception.**

Do I know for sure this will happen?  Of course not.  But the first 4 steps were pretty clear in hindsight.  And it makes sense- Why would ANYONE use the dollar for international money transfer post-Bitcoin?  It depreciates, it is expensive to move, it is heavily regulated and tracked, it is subject to seizure.  It is subject to the whims and mistakes of one government, who are all subject to the whims of their short-sighted voters.

So now how the fuck do you go from a $500 million currency to a $5 trillion currency?  It isn't going to be a linear graph- that doesn't make any sense.  It isn't going to be a smooth rise- Why would it?  If everyone can see a nice, smooth, pretty graph going up, everyone is going to buy into that nice, smooth, pretty graph.  It isn't going to be unidirectional- If the price always went up, everyone would buy into the up, and it would overshoot any and every step.  It isn't going to happen quickly- Many of these steps take time to build confidence and make mistakes to learn from.

No, it is going to be a very painful up and down process.  **Because the technology has so much potential, it is going to experience explosive growth.**  Because it experiences explosive growth, it is **going to have dramatic, painful, scary collapses.**  Then there will be fear.  Then it will stabilize, and then it will start growing again.  A few months later, it will explode again as it approaches the next big transition.

It takes time for Bitcoin companies to get their systems in order.  It takes time for them to earn our trust and for us to weed out the scams and unreliable ones.  It takes time for VC and Angel investors to evaluate and plan Bitcoin ventures.  It takes time for Bitcoin to adapt to its own growth.

For those who think merchant adoption and currency status are the step we should be on, you are gravely mistaken.  The only use that merchant adoption has right now is 1. Getting more people into it/increasing transactions, and 2. making a legal case for why Bitcoin shouldn't be illegal(which would slow us down by 10-25 years).

This is not the last big rise.  This is not the last big crash.  We aren't even at the bottom of this one.  **Until the network either gets cracked or replaced, this is going to keep moving forward.**  There is no going back; We've improved the Gold coin, the Dollar, and the wire transfer all at once.

However, towards the end, it stopped draining.  The tank filled up so that the faucets(always open) started running again.

- 1 cup (210 grams) unsweetened soymilk (or your milk of choice)
- 2 tsp (8 grams) flax seeds 
- 2Tbsp (12 grams) PB2 - OR - 1/3 cup (75 grams) 0% or 2% Greek Yogurt    
- No calorie sweetener to taste          
(Optional: cinnamon for yogurt version, water can be substituted for all or some of the milk)

Stir dry ingredients together, then stir in the milk (and sweetener if it's a liquid). If you are using yogurt instead of PB2, fold in the yogurt or make it in a container with a tight lid and shake like hell. 

PB2 can be a little tough to get smooth and consistent, I either make the oatmeal in a tightly lidded container and really shake like hell both the dry ingredients and after the milk is added, or I dilute the PB2 first in a little liquid and then fold it in (or shake like hell) like the yogurt.

For kids all over Spain and Latin America, a move to Barcelona's La Masia academy was the dream. But it wasn't easy. The routine for the kids was gruelling and required self-discipline and maturity well beyond their years.

Whilst, in many ways, La Masia is the perfect place for technical development and it was here that Riera also learnt important life lessons. For a club whose motto reads ""mes que un club"" – that is, more than a club – the emphasis of character development was more important than anything else.

""The focus principally was to teach people to be a good man, to have good character and be a good, solid person,"" he said.

""If you are not a good man, if you are not a good person, and don’t have a good character, you might be the best player at other clubs, but not at Barcelona. After that, they taught us to play hard, to love the game and to love life every day.""

Even with all Barcelona had to offer, it was still difficult to make it to the top.

""They have great facilities and we played in the best tournaments in the world, so we had all the capabilities to become a great player. But I have many friends from La Masia who aren't footballers, only 1 in 100 make it to LaLiga. It's very difficult.""

Whilst that ratio may be true in other parts of Spain, it certainly isn't at Barcelona. Indeed, some of his 'friends' – Gerard Pique and Lionel Messi – did make it. His recalls his relationship with the Argentine, in particular, with whom he spent many years with at the Nou Camp.

The pair were roommates too, and although Messi often had little to say, Riera laughs when he recounts the numerous hours the two of them would spend gossiping about particular teenage love interests.

""Pique and Messi are the best players in their positions, but for me they are normal people that like the things we all like and enjoy,"" he says. ""In the past, I spent three years with Messi in the under 19s and then the second team and the first team, we went up and down. He was also my roommate so we spent a lot of time together.  

""We spoke about a lot of things, a lot of it about girls because at that time, I was 17 and Messi was 16 and we liked to talk about that.

""He had two characters: off the field he was very calm, very quiet, he doesn’t like talking too much. On the field, he was different, he was the best player, had the ability to get the ball, hold the ball and had all the skills.""

Despite the talent, Riera insists if he had been told Messi would one day become the greatest player ever, he would have dismissed it without hesitation.

""If someone told me at that time that Messi would one day be the best player in the world, possibly ever, it would’ve been a surprise, we would’ve laughed and said it was false. We knew that Messi would be a player in the first-team and a good player, but not like this. In that moment, it was impossible to believe it.

""At the moment, he is the best player and I think in 50 years, we will talk about Messi as the best player in the history of football. There is no doubt about this.""

The things is, for a lot procrastinators, it's going to take us (or took us, in my case) a really long time to get around to reading these funny, insightful, and helpful but very long essays. 

Here is my summary:

Tim uses a several good metaphors to explain and help with procrastination. The first is the Rational Decision Maker (RDM). The RDM is the metaphor for the logical straightforward way we think to accomplish the tasks of our life, most people let the RDM in their head steer them in life. The problem with procrastinators is that, along with the RDM, is the Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, if a monkey eats when he's hungry, sleeps when he's tired, and avoids doing anything hard, he's a pretty successful monkey. The problem is that he is living in a human world. The RDM is great at figuring out direct ways to manage tasks and goals, but has no idea how to handle the monkey, who will often dive for the ""controls"" in the procrastinators mind. The monkey is only interested in what is fun now, and has no concept of the future or what caused the RDM trouble in the past. 

With the monkey in control, then the procrastinator ends up in what the Tim calls ""The Dark Playground."" This is the seemingly endless series of temporarily amusing tasks that distract the procrastinator for doing important things. It's dark because, even though it is full of amusments, this playtime is unearned and feels unsatisfying and crappy. The Monkey's home is the Dark Playground.

A key issue for procrastinators is that they love to make big plans and have big ambitions, but hate the idea of the doing all the little un-fun things to get them accomplished. Nobody just ""builds a house,"" you dig for the foundation, you pour the concrete, you build it up brick by brick. Every stunning accomplishment is just the sum of a series of completely unimpressive tasks -- bricks. The difference between a wannabe writer who thinks every day ""I want to write a novel"" and an actual writer, is that the writer puts out out a couple of pages a day whereas the wannabe doesn't manage to do anything; otherwise, 98% of their day is the same. However, at the end of the year, a writer has a draft of a book, and the procrastinating wannabe has nothing.

The goal to get things done when you are a procrastinator is to deny the Monkey a chance to go into the Dar Playground. When starting a task, Tim calls it the Critical Entrance. The Critical Entrance goes into the Dark Forest of un-fun tasks needed to reach your goal, but at the end is the Happy Playground, where you enjoy your amusements because this play time is earned and you know you have accomplished something. The issue is that the Critical Entrance is inside the Dark Playground and the monkey is going to try to make a break for it. You have to force yourself into the Critical Entrance and deny the Monkey what he insists on. The Dark Forest is also surrounded by the Dark Playground, and when things get particularly tough, the Monkey will see it has his biggest opportunity to get into the Dark Playground and start instant gratifications, this is when it's hardest for the RDM to keep you on track, moving through the Dark Forest.

I know nobody can really make the decision for me about when to stop losing, as long as I am being healthy and at a healthy weight. For my height, I shouldn't go lower that 117lbs so my original goal here (130lbs) is far from going too low. I am  5'3"" and now 135lbs, however, I see this (and even my GW) as people's starting weight here and it makes me think I have ways to go.

However, I noticed that my clothes are fitting me a lot differently and I started wearing a lot of my older clothes again that I had stopped wearing because they just didn't seem to look as good on me anymore (I think I assumed it was because my taste was changing or I was getting older). So I decided to do some measurements. When I was trim, I always took a lot of vain pride in my wasp waist, which slowly disappeared over the last few years. I still had a nice enough hourglass figure and didn't worry too much. But now my waist is back to my skinny 25"" and my bust measurement is 36"" (chest is 30"", I have a really small rib cage) and I don't want to lose too much boobage. (My hips are 38"", which I can take or leave.) I have my first ever (small) thigh gap (holy fuck) but they are still pretty big and I am not showing them to anyone soon. I also have a little tummy, which I never did when I was thin, it was always flat. I don't like that.

I feel a little shy about saying what I did well to get to this point, since I think I might have further to go, but here are some of my tricks and tips. I did it on Weight Watchers and I used their app and I tracked everything I ate, everything. I took their advice and tried to eat at least all of my daily ""points"" if not the flexible weekly ones. Even when I wanted to go lower, I remembered that it was about the long game and going lower would lead to faster weight loss, but I would also feel more drained and deprived and be more likely to go off the regimen big time. So, in the end, eating more helped me eat less. The reason I started to gain the weight was that I got married and we eat out a lot. Though I was still ordering my dainty salad with the dressing on the side, I often found myself eating off his plate of chicken parmigiana, hamburger and fries, etc. And it added up. Now I still eat off his plate, but I track it. I created a food on the app called ""bite"" and it's 1 point (I get 30 a day). So every bite costs me one point. It made a big difference. 

Tracking in general allowed me to see how much I was really eating as well and where my calorie sinks were. I ate less bread, more egg whites and fewer whole eggs, ate PB2 (and lots of it, man I love that stuff) instead of peanut butter, and stopped eating those protein snack bars which are loaded with sugar. I increased my exercise from 4-5 mile walks every day to 5-7. And I stopped eating as much fruit. I know that sounds crazy, but I don't really have a taste for sweets so I didn't have that to give up, but I am a fruit monster. I could easily eat a banana, half a box of strawberries, half a mango, and nice bunch of grapes by the end of the day. That's 200 extra calories. I eat more vegetables to compensate.

So back to the question - fellow loseit ladies who have been in this position, what did you do, or what would you do if you were? Doesn't 135lbs still seem like a lot? Be honest with me!

Thanks!",NSV and a Question: I got my waist back! Maybe it's time to stop losing and maintain?

I was chubby as a kid, had an eating disorder as a teenager and got pretty thin, gained a lot in college after realizing I had an eating disorder, took it off again by having another eating disorder, but managed to get to a nice weight after that just by eating healthfully and mindfully. A few times along the way, the stresses of moving to new places, graduate school, health problems, bad jobs, etc. have occasionally caused my weight to creep up again. Each time, I get back on the good and mindful eating horse, keep track of what I am eating, and exercise more.

Along the way, each time I need to restrict my calories, I manage to find some great foods that make me less deprived. I'll share mine with your here, and would love to hear some ideas from others to add to my repertoire!

(1) PB2 - powdered peanut butter. The first few times I had this, it didn't work for me, but now I love it. I love peanut butter, and I figured out how to make it just the right consistency for either spreading on bread or using as a dip for celery sticks (a go-to snack for me when I am feeling hungrier). One trick for me was to use *cold* water, like from the fridge. This stuff is very low fat and PACKED with protein. Compare: 45 calories for PB2 to 200 for regular peanut butter.

(2) Fage 0% fat greek yogurt - this brand in particular. I whip it up with a little powdered Splenda (normally I hate using artificial stuff like this, but when I am reducing I'll allow it in moderation). It has the look and taste of thickest, most decadent whipped cream. I use it like ice cream, usually top it with fresh strawberries or blueberries. Full of protein, it is so filling and delicious.

(3) Joseph's flax seed and whole wheat pitas - By adding flax seed meal and wheat gluten and cutting out a lot of the wheat flour, you get a delicious, soft pita full of protein and fiber for only 60 calories for a regular sized one. These are not as easy to find, but are in a lot of health food stores and bigger supermarkets that have a sections for healthy foods like this (usually where the gluten free and other specialized foods are).

(4) Espresso macchiatos - just espresso with a bit of foam. I love cafes and good coffee/espresso, I used to drink a cappuccino every day if I could - to the tune of 50 - 150 extra calories a day. Now I have a macchiato and get to sit in the cafe and have a fancy drink and get my buzz on. I'll also have the occasional ""very dry"" cappuccino, which should have very little milk if the barista knows how to make it. Usually Starbucks is pretty good, a short dry cap is just 50 cal, a lot better than the 120 for the usual.

(5) Very diet hot/iced mochas - I make these myself out of unsweetened cocoa powder (1 tsp, 0 cal), instant espresso (much better than instant coffee, 1 heaping spoonful, 0 cal), Splenda (1 packet, 0 cal), and fat free powdered coffee mate (2 tsp, 20 cals). The secret is to put all the powder in your cup/glass and dissolve it all into a paste just a tiny bit of hot water and stir vigorously. Then just add water/ice to volume. I don't make this often because both the Splenda and the Coffee Mate are pretty artificial, and I don't like that, but it's a great treat when I need it.

Sometimes when I discuss what I wish I had known, other people say, ""oh, lord, me too!"" So, in case there is a younger version of me (and those others that commiserate) out there, here is what I would have told myself in my earlier dating life:

(1) *Don't look for someone to complement your weaknesses*. Relationships aren't therapy, and work on your weaknesses rather than look for someone else to help you with them. Become the type of person you would want to date.

(2) *You're right that you're cute, but you could be cuter.* Looks matter a lot more than you think.

(3) *Go for who you really want, not just someone you think is accessible*. Someone can tell when you're settling for them. Plus, those sort of nerdy guys who you think no one else wants, well they are really playing that up and you're falling for it -- and so are a lot of other women.

(4) *It's OK to want a boyfriend and to want to fall in love.* Life is not like the movies/TV where all men are hate the idea of relationships, only want to have sex, and are smothered by women. Plenty of men want to have girlfriends and fall in love. 

(5) *If a guy says he isn't in a good place now to have a relationship,* ***believe him.*** Be honest with yourself if just being a fuck buddy will be enough for you. You can't fuck someone into loving you. And, a lot of the time, ""I'm not into having a relationship right now"" means *with you* (even if he doesn't know it). If he's not feeling it and you are, MOVE ON.

(6) *Date more, and more widely, learn to give and take rejection better.* Move on faster when things aren't what you are looking for.

(7) *Most of the time things won't work out and this has everything to do with personal preferences and nothing to do with worth*. It's like ice cream and meatballs. Both delicious, but not necessarily together.

I was in therapy and on medication, but was only making incremental progress -- until one point when things started to turn around. That the biggest step I could take in recovering from my depression was to realize that I was, to some extent, choosing to stay in it.

I realized there was something comforting about the depression, secure. It gave me a sense of being ""smart,"" that I had special insight into what life was all about. I felt that people who where happy were either lying or deluding themselves. I knew *the truth* -- that life and people were awful and shitty and unfair no matter what you did. Also, this belief absolved me of any responsibility for any of the bad things that happened to me that caused the depression. It exonerated me and kept me safe.

At one point it occurred to me that I didn't need to think so negatively about my life. There were negatives things, sure, but I could choose to be happier. But I decided against it. That's how I realized that I kind of liked being depressed. Things didn't change overnight, of course. But this had been a long a difficult depressive episode for me and I see that realization as the turning point, and not just for that episode. It helped me make future episodes shorter and less profound, or even avoid them altogether. This was when I understood what it means to ""make your own luck.""

I have had way way WAY worse things happened to me since then, real shitstorms of stuff happening to me all at once, things many people maybe get to deal with one at a time or not at all. But I have managed much better then I did before, and I keep on going.

For example, when you get the reviews back for a journal article or are finished with a crit in class, don't react right away. Put down the reviews, and don't think about the critiques for 24 hours. Then come back to it and see what you can do to improve.

This is the real fake-it-til-you-make-it. Sadly, nothing is a bigger social repellant than loneliness. No one wants to take on your emotional baggage when they barely know you. And nobody wants to feel like they interesting to you purely based on the fact that they are better than nothing.  So you need to get out there and meet people, but as if you already have a basically completely full life and are willing to make some space for them. And when people are friendly to you and make overtures, don't over do it. This likely means they are slightly interested in getting to know you better, not in interviewing you immediately to be their new best friend of love of their life. Remind yourself to take things slow.

**Pursue your personal interests.**

Join a writing workshop, take a language class, learn how to throw a pot, learn how to tap dance.  If you have time be lonely, you likely have a lot of time on your hands, use it!  Activities doing what you love are good for the soul, keep you busy and will a full life,  and you will meet people with common interests this way. It also makes you way more interesting when you meet other new people.

**Initiate plans with the friends you already have.**

Don't feel bad about always being the initiator with people. Most people are pretty self-centered and kind of glide through life reacting to stuff, rather than being ""pro-active."" When your friends don't call you, it's not because they don't care, it's likely because they aren't thinking as far ahead as you are, and aren't thinking about that much other than themselves or maybe their immediate nuclear family. And don't look down on being the initiator, it's a great characteristic to have and develop. Initiators are why relationships last. 

**Get out of bad romantic relationships. Being lonely because you are with the wrong person feels worse than being lonely because you are actually alone.**

Sometimes the loneliest people actually have a partner -- but it is not a good fit.  The initial break-up will probably feel like shit times ten, but once the acute period rolls back, you will likely feel much much better.  Get a break-up buddy for this, call a friend, and it's doesn't even need to be a very close one and recruit. I recommend selecting someone who has been through a break-up relatively recently. This is the person you call or text when you are tempted to call or tempt your ex. This is the person you vent to in those first few weeks of wallowing. This is the person who will get your ass out of the house and back into life when it's time to stop the wallowing period. Also, this shows that just having an SO is no panacea for issues of happiness and loneliness, don't romanticize the idea that all you need is a partner and then you'll be all set.

I assumed that most of this came from the fact that they were of a different generation. I wasn't having much trouble myself at all, I felt appreciated and like I was moving up pretty quickly. I also thought that these older women just somehow missed out on how to work well with others, particularly men. Many of them seemed to be irritable and hard to work with, or just too passive. 

I have to admit it also crossed my mind that they might also be being a bit bitter and entitled, wanting to blame ""society"" for the fact that they just didn't have it to succeed or not enough dedication. I noticed there weren't many women in higher-level positions, but I just assumed it was a just because of the era when they were hired and that the younger generation now would come to fill them soon.

However, once I aged out of the cute protegé role, and became more of a peer and competition, it started to happen to me as well. I didn't realize that being young and cute had probably actually *helped* me at work, at least where men were concerned, and my success wasn't just because I was so amazing. I had capitalized on my advantage of being young and attractive, and shamed my older colleagues for having issues. 

Now things are much harder and I see so many of the same things things women have been talking about for decades -- I am left out of important meetings, I am promised things (e.g. funding, office space) that don't materialize and when I bring this to their attention I can be treated like I am being an entitled whiner. They talk over me at meetings, my male colleagues will repeat what I say and then everyone listens, the other person with the same position as me is a man with a BA and makes 25% more than I do (I have a PhD). I can see now why many women left this place to get positions elsewhere and in other fields when they got the chance and wanted to advance.

It was working okay over RF, but I was getting some interference so decided to try and install a composite video mod I got off ebay. To the best of my limited ability, I followed these instructions (http://www.coolretroprojects.com/Atari_2600_AV_Mod_Installation_Guide.pdf) and removed the components labeled L201, R13, and Q202. I now get audio over the RCA cable but only black wavy lines where it's supposed to put out composite video. All the switches and controller inputs seem to work, just no video besides black wavy lines. 

I saw the 7805 voltage regulator was badly corroded/black colored so I tried replacing that with a new one from radio shack only to get the same outcome (audio coming from the carts I put in, but no video). I tested the regulator and the 5v/ground where the RF box used to be (and where you wire in the composite mod), as well as the same spots on the composite mod board and my multimeter is reading 5v throughout. The only thing I that can think of trying to do now is replacing the 3 larger capacitors (C105, C106, C201). Any suggestions to get this thing to output a picture or where I might have gone wrong? 

I've had this console for over 5 years, so I'm pretty pissed I've trashed it. Any help is appreciated.

edit: Fixed it. I broke the trace between L201 and C206 while installing the mod. ",i trashed my Atari 2600 trying to install a composite video mod. Any way to fix it?

It might be in vain, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to remind everyone about Lucasfilms/Disney's cynical and cyclical marketing practices when it comes to home video releases.

I'm sure most of you have already bought an iTunes copy and 3 other ""store exclusive"" copies of Star Wars: The Force Awakens but just in case you haven't been to Walmart or Target yet, I thought I'd offer a little glimpse behind the scenes of Disney Marketing. 

Disney knows Star Wars fans will buy the same polished bantha turd 50 different times in 50 different boxes. Everyone and their droid previously bought at least 5-10 copies of of the Original Trilogy, and 2-3 copies of the prequels. Why would they want to make the first home video release of The Force Awakens a perfect and truly satisfying experience for fans, when they can piecemeal out that experience through re-releases and shoddy Special Editions over the next 30 years? They certainly didn't pay Lucas billions of dollars so they could be nice to the fans.

Disney has not released 4K UHD or 3D versions of the movie yet. They will release those in a few months (in time for Christmas, perhaps?). Force Awakens also hasn't been released worldwide yet (Europe has the classiest, most luxurious region-free [steelbook-case blurays](http://www.bluraysteelbooks.com/)), so if you want a truly unique copy (unlike the [cheap cardboard monstrosity](http://i.imgbox.com/1IZLjiCb.jpg) Target is selling) you should wait until it releases worldwide. 

Also, don't forget that when you buy Force Awakens, you're paying $20-30 for a Bluray/DVD combo pack that will sell for $15 in a year or two. At that point it will be re-released in a combo set for $40 with Star Wars VIII and Rogue One. Then, in a couple more years, the Abrams-produced ""Trilogy"" will come out for $60. Then they'll release a complete Star Wars numbered anthology for $120. Do you really want to buy this same movie 4 times in the next 6 years?

[Patience](http://imgur.com/qbYnw94) young Jedi, save your money and the bluray/dvd release you really want will appear.

When the newbies start looking for a place to talk about 'the great new show' they just found, I want them to not only discover a fantastic community on /r/logh, but also find a well-managed and polished looking subreddit. In order to do that, we need to spend more time promoting this subreddit, and do some design work to make it look more thematic to LoGH.  All of you are doing a great job on the fantastic community part by contributing posts and comments that are active, friendly, and interesting, but the time I can dedicate to promoting the subreddit and my abilities to edit CSS and make this place look as pretty as the Brünhild are somewhat lacking. I'd like to find some new moderators to fill in these gaps.

Here's where you come into the picture: 

* I would like to have some discussion on non-invasive ways to promote this subreddit. If you have ideas on ways to promote the subreddit, and would like to implement them, then let me know either in the comments or by PM. 
* I'd also like to find a user(s) that has experience in working with reddit CSS, and who can help in updating the look of the subreddit. I imagine we can look outside of the subreddit for some help in getting a new logo (that isn't an 16-bit reinhard), etc., but having experience with photoshop and illustrator wouldn't hurt either.

I 'thought' I had bought 2 Bolivian rams at Petsmart for my 30g community tank. Instead, it appears I got 1 Bolivian ram and one mystery fish. It had no obvious markings other than being slightly bigger than the other fish when I brought it home. Now that it's in my mostly clean, stress-free tank, however, it has revealed its true colors. I'm guessing it got dumped in the wrong tank or jumped over from another display section. 

It's currently ~2inches head to tail, and not being very aggressive. My best guess is it's a convict? Please let me know if this thing is going to grow 2 ft and kill all my fish. I'd rather not take it back to fish prison, but I will if that's the case.",Can you help me to identify this cichlid

## Rivals
***
* [](#f/newmexico) **University of New Mexico:**  Known as the “Rio Grande Rivalry”.  This rivalry is one of the oldest on record and dates all the way back to 1894, 18 years before New Mexico officially became a state, and features the only two D1 schools in the state.  Beginning in 1993, the two played for the Maloof Trophy, but the trophy was retired in 2000 because no one cared about it.  The two schools have met a total of 104 times, with New Mexico leading the overall series 68-31-5, including 18 consecutive wins between 1938-1958.  The Lobos won last year’s meeting in Albuquerque by a score of 66-17.  The rivalry will continue in 2014 when the schools meet in Las Cruces on September 20.
  
* [](#f/utep)  **UTEP:**  Known as “The Battle of I-10”.  Separated by only 50 minutes along I-10, this is yet another old rivalry, dating back 97 years.  The two sides play for two trophies, [the silver spade and the Mayor’s Cup, commonly known as the Brass Spitoon](http://i.imgur.com/anZLV22.jpg).  UTEP leads the overall series 54-35-2, including a 42-21 win in Las Cruces last year.  The game between these two set the attendance record at Aggie Memorial Stadium in 1998 with 32,993 in attendance, as well as the attendance record at Sun Bowl Stadium in 1999 with an attendance of 52,247.  This attendance was more than the postseason Sun Bowl, as well as some NFL exhibition games, but that record has since been broken twice.  The two most lopsided games came in 1922 when NMSU won 66-0 and 1948 when UTEP won 92-7.  The two meet again this year in El Paso on September 13, where UTEP will look to expand on their current 5 game winning streak in the series. 

* [](#f/idaho)  **Idaho:**  Not so much as a rivalry, as it is a battle of misfit teams.  Both teams played as independents in 2013 due to the WAC falling apart for football, and both teams joined the Sun Belt Conference for 2014 play.  They played their game last year with both teams getting beaten up by their independent schedule, as they both entered the game with just one win.  New Mexico State won the game 24-16 in Las Cruces.  Both teams hope this rivalry won’t continue based on both of them being the most downtrodden teams in D1, but because they challenge each other for Sun Belt supremacy.  Idaho leads the all-time series between the former WAC and current Sun Belt foes, 12-6.  The two will meet in the Kibbie Dome in Moscow this year on October 18th.

**Conference:** Independent
 
[**2013 roster**](http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/roster/41/new-mexico-state-aggies)

**Key Players:**  QB [Andrew McDonald](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/stats/_/id/531276/andrew-mcdonald), WR [Austin Franklin](http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/17152/type/college/austin-franklin), FS [Davis Cazares](http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/davis-cazares-1.html) 
  
**Biggest Plays:** 

* [Abilene Christian almost converts an 80 yard hail mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bU5VO05Lv4)-  With New Mexico State up 34-29 with 5 seconds left against D2 Abilene Christian, the Wildcats needed to go the length of the field in one play.  Their quarterback threw it downfield to the 45, where it was tipped to the 35 where an Abilene Christian player caught it and immediately pitched it.  It looked like he was going to score, until he was pushed out of bounds on the 5 yard line, preserving the win for the Aggies, their first of the year.

* [Austin Franklin's final 5 games of the season](http://i.imgur.com/toZ3XRp.jpg)-  This is cheating, but Franklin made the Aggies offense go the final 5 games of the season, as it took him a couple games to get going following a 4 game academic suspension.  In those five games he went for 11-122-0, 13-140-2, 10-145-2, 4-58-0, and 6-64-2.  Those two touchdowns in the final game were the difference in the Aggies' win over Idaho.  It's no surprise that with his talent, he entered the NFL Draft a year early and got picked up as an undrafted free agent by the St. Louis Rams.

## The Greats  
****
**Greatest Games:** 

* [1959 Sun Bowl](http://i.imgur.com/FzKF2Vm.jpg):  After tying in their first bowl game in 1936, NMSU finally made it back to a bowl in 1959, playing North Texas State in the Sun Bowl.  NMSU started out strong in the first quarter with a 57 yard TD from QB Charley Johnson to RB Pervis Atkins to open up the scoring.  After showcasing their offense, the Aggie defense proved that they came to play as well, recovering a fumble in the end zone to put NMSU up 14-0.  The Aggies went on to win, 28-8, to claim their first bowl victory in school history.  QB Johnson won the MVP, throwing for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns.

* [1960 Sun Bowl](http://i.imgur.com/lDqvsDO.jpg):  After going undefeated in the regular season and being ranked 17th in the AP Poll, NMSU took on 9-1 Utah State in the battle of the Aggies in the Sun Bowl.  Utah State took a 13-6 lead into halftime with 2 rushing touchdowns, but New Mexico State shut down Utah State's league leading offense in the second half.  NMSU got a rushing TD from Bob Gaiters and a passing TD from Charley Johnson to E.A.(Sports) Sims.  NMSU's defense was able to stop Utah State on 4th down to secure the 20-13 win.  Johnson was named Sun Bowl MVP for the second straight year, and would later be inducted into the Sun Bowl Hall of Fame in 1994.       

**Greatest Players:** 

* [Danny Villanueva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Villanueva) played a major role on NMSU's undefeated 1960 team, and played in both of NMSU's bowl victories. In the NFL, he served as a placekicker and punter for the Los Angeles Rams (1960-1965), and set the franchise record with 100 consecutive extra point conversions while playing for the Dallas Cowboys (1965-1967). He retired with 42.8 career punting average without a block and 491 career points. After retirement, he became a sportscaster for Los Angeles TV station, KNBC. 

* [Charley Johnson](http://i.imgur.com/bwjXGKa.jpg):  The starting QB on NMSU's only 2 bowl winning teams, Johnson became the only player to date to win back to back Sun Bowl MVPs.  He is a member of the NMSU Hall of Fame, and the only Aggie to ever have his jersey retired.  He eventually went on to play in the NFL, playing with the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Oilers, and Denver Broncos.  He was named to the Pro Bowl in 1963, and was inducted into the Broncos Ring of Fame in 1986.  Johnson received an engineering degree from NMSU, and while playing in the NFL, obtained a Master's Degree in Chemical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis.  He retired as a professor of Chemical Engineering from New Mexico State in 2012. 

* [Pervis Atkins](http://i.imgur.com/nYqQxaU.jpg):  Atkins played running back primarily, but also played some tight end and even some kicker.  Atkins led the nation in rushing yards (971), rushing touchdowns (13), yards from scrimmage (1272), and touchdowns from scrimmage (16) in 1959, as he and Johnson led New Mexico State to the Aggies first bowl game win.  He played for the Aggies in their undefeated season in 1960 as well, and even though his stats were considerably lower, he still finished 9th in the Heisman voting.  Atkins went on to play in the NFL for the LA Rams, Washington Redskins, and Oakland Raiders.  In 2009, Atkins was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.    

**Greatest Coaches:** 

* [Warren B. Woodson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_B._Woodson) coached the NMSU Aggies from 1958-1967. In his tenure as NMSU's head coach, Woodson won the Border Conference Championship by going 11-0 in 1960, won the Sun Bowl twice, and had a combined record of 63–36–3 (.632). Woodson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989.

## Traditions
****
* [Painting of ""A"" Mountain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=conxDQt_1oQ): Beginning in 1920, students from New Mexico A&M climbed Tortugas Mountain and hauled 5 gallons of whitewash on the mountain, using it to paint an ""A"" on the mountain as an April Fool's joke.  Beginning in the late 1990's, students go up to the mountain and make an ""A"", which signifies the start of the football season.  100, 42 watt light bulbs are used to light up the ""A"" during game days.  It was most recently lit up blue in order to spread awareness of autism.  The ""A"" stands 330 feet tall.     

* Victory Bell:  Given as a gift by the class of 1939, the Victory Bell was to be rung for Aggie sporting victories, including being rung for 24 straight hours in 1942 after the Aggies won the Border Conference Championship in basketball.  After being peed on numerous times (I assume), the Victory Bell was moved near the engineering complex.  In 1990, the bell was removed in order to build a pedestal for it, but after this wasn't done, the bell remained in storage until 2002.  Starting in 2002, the Bell was moved to Memorial Stadium, where it salutes Aggie touchdowns with its chimes.  
 
* Wear Crimson Fridays: Students, faculty, and staff wear crimson on Friday to cover the campus with the school's most predominant color.  Alumni and fans all over the world wear it as well to show their support, to make it a worldwide tradition.

* [The Wonder Dog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1U6RKjaMg4):  Starting in the mid 1990's, every Aggie kickoff would be retrieved by a dog.  Smoki, the first wonder dog, was a [Border Collie and Australian Shepherd mix](http://i.imgur.com/xf1AreZ.jpg), who retired in 2002.  The traidition ended until 2012, when tryouts were held to become the next Wonder Dog.  [Striking, a 4 year old Border Collie](http://i.imgur.com/kzeQeSR.jpg) was chosen, and is still retrieving kick off tees to this day.

## What Is and What is to Come
***

**Last Year:**

2013 was a year to forget for Aggie fans, as playing an independent schedule was too much and the team ended up with just 2 wins, the third time in four years NMSU has won two games or fewer.  The defense was one of the worst in the nation, finishing 124th in yards allowed per game and 123rd in points allowed per game.  In one of the worst 6 game stretches for any defense in the history of college football, the Aggie defense gave up 292 points (almost 49 points per game) and 3,272 yards (545 yards per game) from October 5 to November 23.  The offense showed more signs of life than the defense, especially after star WR Austin Franklin came back from his 4 game academic suspension.  The Aggies ran a balanced offense, with 135.2 yards rushing per game (94th in the nation) and 240.9 passing yards per game (59th in the nation). 

**This Year:**

2014 doesn't promise to be a very strong year in Las Cruces, as leading WR Austin Franklin is now in the NFL with the Rams, and starting QB Andrew McDonald, leading rusher Germi Morrison, and 4 year starting tackle Davonte Wallace all graduated, meaning the Aggies will be looking for who their star player will be all season long.  Martin loaded up on quarterbacks, signing 5 incoming freshmen and 1 JUCO transfer, so expect to see a lot of mixing and matching this year as Martin tries to find his quarterback of the future.  The o-line has some good experience, as they have combined for 73 starts, and 3 players with at least a year of starting experience.  Despite losing their top rusher (only 451 yards), Brandon Betancourt (415 yards, 2 TDs in 2013) and Xavier Hall (247 yards, 2 TDs in 2013) return for 2014.  The returning wide receivers also have experience, with 4 seniors, a junior, and a senior tight end.  Adam Shapiro, Jerrel Brown, and Joseph Matthews combined for 91 catches, 1231 yards, and 13.5 yards per catch.  It will be interesting to see if one or several of these players can pick up the slack that Franklin left behind.  The Aggies also have a 3 star redshirt freshman wideout in Prentavious Morehead who will also be looking to make a splash.  The defense will also be looking to replace experienced players, with five of the six players with at least 30 tackles last year are gone, as are the four players who played in all 12 games last year.  If the defense wants to improve this year, the d-line will have to start putting pressure on the QB and making plays, as the defensive ends from NMSU combined for just 2.5 sacks last year, and the line's leading tackler finished 10th on the team in tackles.

The 2014 Aggies are a very young team, and shuffling along the line and at quarterback won't help anything.  NMSU and coach Doug Martin seem to be building for the future, which means that this season will most likely be a lost cause.  The best thing that can happen to NMSU this year is that they find their QB of the future and maybe win a couple of games in the process.  I'm predicting 3-9 this year, but the Aggies look poised to make a run at the Sun Belt in a couple of years under the guide of Martin.

It is said that Littlefinger is the best player of the game, but Gurm is a merciless fellow. Littlefinger is too cocky and has made his schemes far too intricate to emerge from this unscathed. 

I think Littlefinger's plans are already starting to unravel. Alayne is still married, and I think he's seriously underestimated both her and her little husband. Littlefinger seems to be blinded by her similarity to Cat, and he's bound to overlook her at some point. He seems to believe the Imp is as good as dead, but he's far from it. How long before Alayne's marriage comes back to haunt him? When will her growing fondness for Sweet Robin create opposition for his plans to murder the young Lord? How will he handle Alayne when she tips over his ladder? (excuse the show reference) What will happen if Lady Stoneheart comes to the Vale?

I'm hoping that this will be an honest, civil debate. It may seem like a strange topic, but like I said it's been on my mind.

Specifically, I guess my question is this: In America, is being an atheist as challenging or as ""risky"" as being gay? Are there any parallels to how gays and atheists are thought of or treated? Are there any major differences?

Is being an open atheist as ""brave"" as being openly gay? Just to clarify, I'm not looking for an ego boost here...I'm an atheist but I'm not as open about it as I want to be. I can honestly say that I'm a bit afraid to be very open, and I would rather just not go through the trouble. So there will be no glory for me in the atheist crusade, at least not for now.

I personally think that being openly atheist holds more than a few parallels to being openly gay, and that this is one of the reasons that atheists are quick to champion gay rights. Below, I'll present a few of the arguments I've heard against this viewpoint, and then explain why I don't necessarily agree with them. I hope that you all will add your own arguments for or against below, in addition to refuting mine if you feel the need to do so. So here goes.

- **Being gay is a biological fact. Being atheist is a philosophical choice.**

I personally don't think this one is true, but it has some merit. I think most us here on /r/atheism would agree that being gay isn't simply a lifestyle choice. I guess the implication of atheism being a ""choice"" is that regardless of it's moral ramifications, you know what it is you're doing and what the consequences might be. So if there any consequences you don't like, you should have been prepared for those. Homosexuals didn't choose to be homosexual, they were born that way, so persecuting them for that is paramount to persecuting the left-handed. Even if you think being left-handed is wrong, it doesn't make much sense to hate someone for something they had no control over.

But is atheism really a choice? I don't think so. Keep in mind Pascal's Wager. Pascal himself admits that one cannot simply ""choose"" to believe. Instead he advocates that a non-believer who would like to become a true believer simply ""act"" as though he believes, and hope that belief develops on it's own. I see a strong parallel here with ""praying the gay away."" And we all know that's bullshit. 

I used to be a Christian, as I think most of us did. When I ""became"" an atheist, I remember it being not so much of a choice as simply realizing that I didn't believe in any sort of God. So in my opinion, atheism is not a choice.

- **You can hide the fact that you're an atheist much more easily than one can hide the fact that he/she is gay.**

Again, a valid point on the surface. I could (and do) live pretty normally without really advertising that I'm an atheist. I can casually lie and imply that I'm more or less a Christian if I want to avoid discrimination or just avoid a headache. I even know a fair bit about the Bible, so I could not-so-casually lie if I had to. If I really wanted no one to find out that I was an atheist, then most likely, no one ever would. Most people in America will assume that you're a Christian anyway, unless you tell them otherwise. 

Being gay has one big difference: faking it would effectively mean that you can't really date people you're interested in, or seriously look for a partner without risk of exposing your lie. If I were out with my atheist significant-other, holding hands and clearly looking like a couple, no one is going to pick me out as an atheist. Gays don't have that luxury. Most people would consider that an important part of a normal life.

The argument breaks down a bit when you consider the fact that everyone *should* be able to live life freely without persecution for their beliefs or lifestyle. It's not morally more acceptable for atheists to live a lie, simply because they can do so more easily. But the fact remains: it is easier. And that makes a difference.

- **Atheists aren't persecuted to the same extent as homosexuals.**

It's hard to argue against this one. I personally don't know any statistics, but I'm not aware of much violence that is directed against atheists. Some prejudice, sure. Being open about your atheism is not a good idea if you want to run for public office in America, for example. This may be because, as I mentioned above, atheists can hide more easily, so if they aren't very public about being atheist, they may go fairly unnoticed.

I might be wrong about this one though. If anyone knows more about this subject, let me know.

So...what do you all think? Is the gay person the brother (or sister) in arms of the atheist? Or is there really no comparison between the challenges facing the two groups?",Atheism vs. homosexuality: are the challenges faced by each group comparable in any way?

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a Segwit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a Segwit wallet. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to segwit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its Segwit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a Segwit address.

 via [HowToToken.com](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-segwit-transactions/):

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a Segwit Tx if the sending address is a Segwit address.

Is there a hardware wallet that does segwit addresses?

- Yes, Trezor supports Segwit by default. Ledger Nano also has support.

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

COINXBT holds bitcoin directly and its price per share is based on a 0.005 multiple of the current bitcoin price.

For example, if the current price of bitcoin is $10000USD, a share of COINXBT will be worth $50USD (ie: $493 Swedish Kroner)

**HOW-TO TRADE**

Only some Canadian brokerages allow you to trade on eligible international exchanges in your TFSA. Some do not. 

Typically placing trades on international exchanges online is not an option and must be made over the phone broker-assisted at a much higher cost than typical North American securities.


**CANADIAN BROKERS**

I've called pretty much every brokerage to inquire if international securities can be held in a TFSA and what the fee is to transact. You may want to call yourself to see if policies have changed, but here's a summary:

- National Bank: $75 per trade + $0.06 per share (confirmed works)
- TD: Fee dependent on amount traded. Up to $5K is $187, $80K would be $520 per trade (confirmed works)
- CIBC: $250 minimum, based on trade amount. $50K would be about $350 to buy and $350 to sell (confirmed works)
- Scotia iTrade: $250 CAD per trade CAD, unlimited shares & order size (should work)
- BMO Investorline: Fee-based on total trade amount. $50K would be $325 to buy $225 to sell, $50-$60K would be $350 to buy $240 to sell (should work)


Not available, or not available in RRSP/TFSA:

- Interactive Brokers, can trade it, but not in RRSP/TFSA
- Questrade
- Royal Bank
- Credential Direct
- HSBC (has access to almost every exchange other than Stockholm)
- Qtrade
- Virtual Brokers


---------------------------------


**FAQ's**

Are you sure it's legal? I'm quite sure it's illegal.

- This is 100% legal. The Stockholm Stock Exchange is a RRSP/TFSA eligible exchange. Source: https://www.fin.gc.ca/act/fim-imf/dse-bvd-eng.asp

Who is your broker? CAD account?

- I used National Bank Direct Brokerage. The fee's came out to $75 per trade + $0.06 per share. 

 For example, the commission for a trade I did for 885 shares of COINXBT was $75 + $53.10 for a total of $128.10. Canadian funds were used to make the purchase and there were no forex fees for converting to Swedish Kroner (SEK)

How do I make a trade once I'm ready?

- Call your brokerage and say you want to place a trade on the Stockholm stock exchange. You may be forwarded to a person that specializes in that, and eventually to a broker that deals with placing order on international exchanges. Tell them the symbol to trade is COINXBT and the name of the ETN is ""Bitcoin Tracker One"".

How do I calculate the number of shares to trade to max out my TFSA?

- The price of COINXBT is in SEK. In my case using NB I took my balance minus anticipated fees divided by the current price to see how many shares I could buy. 

 For example: For a $10,000 TFSA, current COINXBT price = $554.77SEK (84.27CAD), would be 117 shares at a cost of $9859.59 + $82.02 commission for a total of $9941.61CAD

Market or Limit order?

- The first time I placed an order for COINXBT I tried to place a limit order a little below the market price. Over the next week the price of bitcoin ran up a lot and didn't come down. I ended up buying a lot higher. Since then I've been placing limit orders slightly above the current price or just market orders so that they go through right away. I've had no issues doing it either way.

When can I trade? Is it only possible to make the trade while the Swedish market is open and the TSX are open at the same time? Or can you place the order at any time of day? 
 
- You should be able to place the trade anytime your Canadian broker is open (~9:00 - 17:30 EST). However, it the time is outside Stockholm's trading hours, it will be entered as an after-hours trade and will go live when Stockholm opens the next day. My understanding is that the Stockholm exchange closes at 5:30PM (11:30 EST). Here's a comparison of timezones showing Stockholm trading hours: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=2673730,6077243,5946768&h=2673730&date=2017-10-3&sln=9-18.5
 
Which number did you use to contact the brokerages?

- Contact numbers for various Canadian brokers: http://www.moneysmartsblog.com/canadian-online-discount-stock-brokerage-comparison/

What happens when there is a fork?

- XBT Provider has said they will monitor forks for 3-months and then decide what action to take. In the case of Bitcoin Cash, they sold the forked coins and distributed it as a dividend to anyone that held ETN shares on the fork date.

What about other cryptocurrencies?

- An ethereum ETN was recently launched: COINETH that also trades on the Stockholm exchange. https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/COINETH:SS

 Other than that, I am not aware of any other eligible crypto securities that can be held in a RRSP/TFSA

How is the price of COINXBT determined?

- It's based on the average price of the top 3 exchanges

Why not just buy GBTC?

- GBTC is traded on the OTC exchange in the US and is not RRSP/TFSA eligible

Why can't I place a trade online myself?

- For now, there are no crypto ETF's on North American exchanges. They have been in the works for years in the US, but no approvals yet. Evolve funds recently said they plan to launch a Canadian Bitcoin ETF.

 Trading COINXBT is a bit of a hassle, but you're getting in ahead of everyone else that are not willing to put in the time/effort. 
 
 Once the Canadian/US ETF launches, it will probably be worth it to sell COINXBT and switch to the North American one which should be easy to trade online just like other ETF's.

Futures will open up investment into BTC to even more investors/speculators, but they'll also now enable large entities to transact & settle in BTC while hedging their risk. Merchant/Consumer adoption could explode in advance of lightening network implementation. Possible ecosystems:

- Square has already announced BTC integration coming. Will give BTC access to all Square users. Square will hold BTC reserves, hedge them with futures, and allow it's users to transact off chain within their own BTC ecosystem.
- Apple Pay integration coming soon? If so, that could keep small transactions off chain as an alternative/compliment to the lighting network, and allow consumers to draw from their BTC. Partnering with Coinbase & other major exchanges could allow for seamless off chain BTC use.

""Price Inversely proportional to velocity"" here is not a vague correlational statement, but an exact one from ""MV = PQ"", which was my grandfather's license plate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange

Which means that #bitcoin's governance problem is worse than you thought. Fast transactions = higher velocity = lower price, so #Bitcoin holders literally have a direct incentive for a slow network (it's not just a coordination problem)

You can argue that faster txs = greater utility = more future demand, and there's some truth, but that's an indirect/distant/second order effect compared to the direct/immediate/first order effect of velocity decreasing price.

This suggests that store-of-value and medium-of-exchange uses are in opposition. Hodlers want high prices, which means a slow network. Exchangers are price-indifferent but want speed.

This makes investing in tokens for any non store-of-value a sketchy proposition. An effective enabler of exchange (financial, storage, CPU, bandwidth, whatever) must be fast & low-friction, which is opposed to token appreciation.

**In what order should I read Nietzsche?**

There are two schools of thought here. School 1 holds that you should read Nietzsche chronologically, i.e.:

1. *The Birth of Tragedy* 
2. *Untimely Meditations* 
3. *Human, All Too Human* 
4. *The Dawn* aka *Daybreak*
5. *The Gay Science*
6. *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*
7. *Beyond Good and Evil*
8. *On the Genealogy of Morals*
9. *The Case of Wagner*
10. *Twilight of the Idols*
11. *The Antichrist*
12. *Ecce Homo*
13. *Nietzsche contra Wagner*

School 2 holds that you should instead begin with some of the easier works, such *Beyond Good and Evil*, *Genealogy of Morals*, or *Twilight of the Idols*, before moving on, if you're still interested, to the rest of the Nietzsche's work. 

My personal opinion is that the the second school is preferable in most cases. If you're certain that you'll be reading *all* of Nietzsche's corpus, then the chronological path is probably superior. Otherwise, you'll be better served by starting with the works you'll get most out of: you don't need to read all of Nietzsche to understand his central tenets, and you'll get a good chunk of his central tenets from any of the three books mentioned. 

You'll notice that this list does not include *The Will to Power*. Contemporary scholars have determined that the book of that name was heavily edited by Nietzsche's anti-Semitic sister. This does not mean that the aphorisms contained within are not worth reading, but it is *better*, if possible, to read them in the appropriate context and with some background in Nietzsche already in hand. 

**What translations should I buy?**

Kaufmann and Hollingdale are both fine, and are likely to be the ones you will find most cheaply. If you're certain that you're going to do scholarly work on Nietzsche, then the recent Stanford editions are the best translations available, and the Cambridge editions are serviceable. Kaufmann's likely remain the easiest and most pleasurable to read.

**What other authors should I read first?**

Full disclosure, I'm of the opinion that there are so many things that one could read that you should start somewhere, and Nietzsche is a fine enough place to start. However, a familiarity with the basic tenets of [the Presocratics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/presocratics/),--particularly [Heraclitus](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/)--[Socrates](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/), [Plato](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/), [Kant](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/), and [Schopenhauer](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/) will be extremely helpful for particular parts of Nietzsche's corpus. Additionally, knowledge of the work of Wagner and Goethe is essential for understanding Nietzsche's discussion of these figures, and *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* is very purposefully modeled on the Bible. 

**What about secondary sources?**

There's a substantial amount of literature on Nietzsche, and much of it of low quality. I've broken the list up into rough groups that attempt to indicate why one might want to read the source in question.

*Influential interpreters whose views pre-date sixty years of research into Nietzsche's manuscripts*: Deleuze, Heidegger, Hollingdale, Kaufmann, .

*Influential second-wave English interpreters*: Danto, Magnus, Maudemarie Clark, Nehemas, Schatt, Solomon.

*Contemporary interpreters of note*: Christa Davis Acampora, R. Lanier Anderson, Jessica Berry, Maudemarie Clark, Ken Gemes,  Nadeem Hussain, Christopher Janaway, Paul Kastafanas, Brian Leiter, Simon May, Bernard Reginster, John Richardson, Simon Robertson, Julian Young. (I've probably missed a couple.)

If you're looking for an overall introduction, Julian Young's *Friedrich Nietzsche* is likely to be your best starting place. In a pinch, however, either Kaufmann's or Hollingdale's intellectual biography will do, though the reader should recognize that both are now dated.",Nietzsche: In what order should I read him?

There is a [new development](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-of-miami-lawsuit-mcginn_561fbe37e4b050c6c4a47ec1) in the Colin McGinn harassment scandal: the graduate student is suing McGinn, Miami University, and another professor there.

**Background**

The very basics go like this: graduate student was accepted into Miami University and became a research assistant of Colin McGinn (who was likely then the department's most famous member). Over the course of 2011 and 2012, he sent her a number of texts and emails involving repeated propositions of sex and descriptions of how much he wanted to have sex with her. McGinn has since claimed that they had a consensual (but non-sexual) relationship, which she has vehemently denied. She eventually filed a complaint with the University. I think it is pretty widely accepted that the University convinced (or forced) McGinn to retire rather than face being fired. McGinn went public to defend himself, making a number of insinuations about the graduate student in the process. Another professor in the department, Ed Erwin, then publicly supported McGinn and (allegedly) privately admonished the graduate student. 

**What is going to happen?**

I can't speak much on the case against the university or that deeply on the case against Erwin; both of these rely far too heavily on private records that I don't have access to. Legally speaking, I think a judgment against the University is unlikely (whether or not one is justified): similar past cases simply haven't really gone anywhere. Much more likely would be a settlement on the University's part. As for Erwin, it all depends on what is in the private emails and how much the student can substantiate her claims about their private conversations. That said, given the admittedly one-sided presentation of the private emails that we have (see the suit linked at the bottom of the HuffPo article), I think the range here is somewhere between ""judgment against him"" and ""no judgment but no longer employed by Miami."" It's *possible* that the the context of the emails could make the quoted passages seem less maliciously retaliatory, but it's hard to imagine context that would make them seem like appropriate actions for someone to take. 

What about McGinn? When there was less information available, I [claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1jmu2u/colin_mcginn_and_the_debate_over_women_in/cbg8y9q) the following: 

1. McGinn's original behavior was almost certainly harassment. ...
2. His (since-removed) blog posts in response unquestionably violated university policy regarding retaliation, and were also in extremely poor taste. If your defense against a sexual harassment charge is ""the person in question (and everybody else too) was too dumb to get that I was joking,"" you're probably an asshole.

Again, the further information we have is presented either for effect (HuffPo) or is in the suit itself, so there may be missing context. That said, given the information we have, McGinn committed sexual harassment and retaliation. I really can't see any possibility for grey area here, *even* if we were to grant that there was some sort of romantic relationship (which the parties contest), McGinn's followup to the student's explicit ending of that relationship alone would constitute harassment. Equally, even ignoring his blog posts, McGinn's private circulation of the student's name and his assertion--to the entire department that she was then still a part of!--that she was a ""serial liar"" is textbook retaliation. I'm not a lawyer, and the actual grounds for a suit under Title IX may well be dramatically different than the grounds for a Title IX investigation. But *under the Title IX definitions*, McGinn's actions are remarkably cut and dried instances of harassment and retaliation.

(I'll add: it's really hard for me to read the emails and texts that are available as anything other than incredibly one-sided harassment. Those are the responses of someone who doesn't know how to deal with the situation and wants it all to go away.)

**Why should we care?**

Well, we should care for the same reason that we care about the Northwestern case, the Rutgers case, and any other instance of people behaving badly: people were harmed and immoral actions were committed. But the question is probably more: why is this in /r/philosophy? There's a way in which McGinn is the poster boy for a series of similar events at Colorado, Northwestern, and Yale. How to deal with these cases has been (and remains) one of the major issues that philosophers feel that they need to deal with as a profession. There are questions about the relationship between less extreme forms of this behavior and philosophy's continued inability to attract and retain female students. Let's put this another way: anyone who is interested in a career in philosophy needs to be ready to confront these issues. 

There's also the question--the more broadly academic question--about where situations like this fit into the world of academic freedom and tenure. Let me be clear: **I'm** about as far to one side of this ""debate"" as is possible. There simply is nothing similar about this case and (say) the Saliata affair. But there are those who see the issue of sexual harassment in academia in terms of free speech. Both this case and others have sometimes been discussed in terms of a dichotomy between ""real harassment"" and oversensitive students (and administrators) who see everything that offends them as unacceptable. Philosophy as a discipline has recently been at the heart of these controversies, but it is a ""debate"" that has significant purchase in the broader university setting.

My own opinion is that defending people like McGinn and Ludlow under the guise of ""academic freedom"" or ""oversensitive students"" limits our ability to effectively defend academic freedom and free speech in cases like the Saliata affair or the recent idiocy at Wesleyan. And drawing the line between the two seems to me *precisely* the sort of job that most of us think that philosophy should be doing.

It also could have been the case that something other than H2O filled the oceans, rivers, and streams of earth.

Since the publication Kripke's *Naming and Necessity*, most philosophers have agreed that while the above are real possibilities, they don't show that ""Hesperus might not have been Phosphorus"" or that ""water might not have been H2O."" These are impossibilities because the terms involved refer to certain objects and the objects involved--*H2O*, *Venus*--could not have been different from themselves. H2O couldn't have been CO2, because then it would be CO2, not H2O.

The quick gloss of Kripke's point blurs together three issues (and ignores a fourth issue present in Kripke's work):

1. Semantic: in non-technical terms, what our words ""mean"" (i.e., ""water"" refers to H2O).
2. Modal: what is possible (i.e. the world could have been such that there was a different chemical filling our oceans, rivers, and streams).
3. Essential: what it is that is essential for various objects (i.e., the chemical structure of H2O is what makes it H2O).
4. Meta-semantic (sometimes also ""foundational semantics""): how it is that our terms get the meaning that they have. 

(I'll largely be ignoring 1, 3, and 4.) The point discussed above could also be characterized in this manner: when speaking strictly, we cannot describe a situation in which some other chemical fills our rivers, streams, and oceans as one in which ""water"" is a different compound, because *that*'s not possible. We need to find some other way to describe it. 

Like all philosophical views, this one leaves some unresolved problems. For instance, the statement ""Hesperus is Phosphorus"" seems to inform us that we're not living in a world where Hesperus isn't Phosphorus. But, according the Kripkean picture, that latter world isn't possible: it is necessarily the case that wherever Venus exists, it is itself. So what does ""Hesperus is Phosphorus"" tell us? Robert Stalnaker, one of the most--if not the most--important and influential philosophers on the topic of modality, developed what's come to be known as ""Two-Dimensional Semantics"" in order to handle this problem.

As Stalnaker likes to present it, here is the issue. Given the way our world is, certain sentences are necessarily true: water couldn't be anything other than H2O. If our world were different, however--if the ""watery stuff"" was composed of a different compound--then ""water is H2O"", spoken in the language of that world, would be necessarily false. If we call our world *i* and the other one *j*, we can represent the situation with a table, where we evaluate a sentence horizontally from a world. As you can see, the sentence is either going to be necessarily true or necessarily false.

 | *i* | *j* | ...
---|---|----|----
*i* | T | T | T
*j* | F | F | F

Stalnaker's claim is that this is the right representation of possibility: we are ultimately only able to describe how things *might* be using the terms for things we find around us. Because what our words mean is tied to how the world actually is, we cannot just cleanly describe all the various possibilities out there. So, Stalnaker claims, we use the ""diagonal"" reading of ""Hesperus is Phosphorus"" in order to say that the world is like *i* instead of like *j*. By using the two-dimensional framework, we can see how while our world is not necessarily like *i*, it is necessary, given that fact, that ""Hesperus is Phosphorus.""

In recent years, David Chalmers has taken the two-dimensional framework in another direction, what he calls ""epistemic two-dimensionalism."" The epistemic gloss is like this: what we above called the diagonal reading is a purely ""a priori"" limiting of possibilities (because it has nothing to do with our discoveries regarding the world), while the horizontal line of truth table regards ""a posteriori"" necessities (those that depend on facts about how the world turns out).

Chalmers' adaptation is intuitive, but it is not innocent. Recall Stalnaker's view about the description of possibilities: we can only use the resources of the world around us to describe what might be. As Chalmers recognizes, in order to get his account off of the ground, we need to be able to describe (and contemplate) possibilities using languages and thoughts that are not dependent on the way the world actually is, but are instead constrained solely by logic, mathematics, and other forms of a priori reasoning. The question is whether such a language is even possible. ",Stalnaker vs. Chalmers on possibility

Why do I have this problem? Williamson begins with three key claims: (1) we ought to assume knowledge is a mental state, (2) knowledge cannot be analysed into its components, (3) knowledge is factive. Now, I would take (3) to give us good reason to abandon (1) (which I'm frankly not sure why we held in the first place). Since no other paradigmatic mental state is factive, knowledge is probably not a mental state. Williamson just straight denies that the other mental states are not factive, however, claiming that ""seeing *that*"" and ""remembering *that*"" are factive attitudes that one can have towards a proposition. This argument seems unimaginably weak to me, in no small part because I just don't share that intuition, but also because one can simply claim that the ""that"" Williamson makes such a big deal serves to indicate the ""seeing truly"" claim, which is factive but not a mental state. Whatever. Let's stipulate that this argument is unpersuasive for either side.

What other arguments can one give for knowledge being a mental state / attitude? Why should I follow Williamson in this regard?

This divide can be presented a number of ways. It is my contention that none of them usefully and accurately delineate two separate philosophical traditions, and I'll consider them from ""stupid"" to ""just bad history"":

* Good philosophy vs. bad philosophy; clear and precise writing vs. obfuscating writing

Obviously, the first way of making the distinction begs the question against those of the alternative tradition; however, the second does so to nearly the same extent. One cannot claim that the technical language invented (for instance) by Carnap is intrinsically clearer than that developed by Heidegger. Both are technical languages, both aim at clarifying the central issue involved by introducing ways of getting around the imprecise and confusing natural language.

* Different areas of interest; analytic is more like science while continental is more like literature (or history)

There is *some* truth to the first, but it isn't like analytic philosophy is solely preoccupied by numbers or epistemology while continental is solely concerned with ethics (or vice-versa). Both have their share of philosophers who are interested in virtually all of the different subdisciplines one can think of. The second is equally problematic: virtually everyone sees themselves as perfecting their particular ""science"" as much as possible. Marxists of a certain stripe, for example, would claim that their analysis is motivated by an understanding of economic structures that is just as scientific as any work in analytic philosophy. This way of drawing the distinction also relies on a particular view of both science and philosophy that may or may not be accurate and is certainly heavily contested; at the very least, we would like to see some indication of a consensus about what is special about science before we claim that a particular discipline that shares almost no methodology or areas of focus with hard science is more scientific than another, similar, discipline.

* Geographical

Again, there is some truth to this characterization--""analytic"" philosophy is mostly Anglo-American--but it is largely inaccurate. Many key figures in analytic philosophy have been German or Austrian. A number of key figures in various ""continental"" traditions lived in the United States (e.g., the entirety of the Frankfurt school, Michael Hardt, Hannah Arendt, etc.).

* Historical

This is where most people draw the distinction, and where I have as well in the past. There *seems* to be good reason to do so: after all, we Anglo-American philosophers are told about Frege and Russell and Moore and the famous overcoming of British Idealism. From there, we think, the roots of analytic philosophy stem. 

The problem is that that story isn't really accurate. For one thing, it wasn't as though the break was decisive: McTaggart, for example, continued to interact with Russell and Moore for years after the latter published their allegedly revolutionary work. For another, the story (as normally told) traces analytic philosophy from Cambridge to Vienna, but that movement is much more complicated than it is often made out to be. For all the Vienna Circle was influenced by Wittgenstein, they were also heavily influenced by the neo-Kantianism that was prevalent in Germany at the time, the same neo-Kantianism that Heidegger, Cassirer, and Jaspers were reacting to. 

Indeed, as Michael Friedman has argued, Heidegger and Carnap were largely concerned with the same phenomena couched in the same terms: for the latter, the promise of modern logic was that it promised to allow us to bypass traditional metaphysical questions and create new, scientific, languages that would fulfill our (neo-)Kantian needs and allow us to structure our experience in a new way. For Heidegger, this was the danger: too much, he argued, would be lost.

Finally, such a story ignores that idealism was not the most prevalent philosophy on the continent during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Various neo-Kantians had been arguing for types of realism much like what Russell and Moore ended up advancing for decades before the supposed break, positivism had a strong hold in both Germany and France, and--arguably--philosophy was more connected than it would ever be again with mathematics and science, with notables like Helmholz, Duhem, Poincare, and Hilbert contributing important philosophical positions.

In other words, up until WWII, the two different traditions were largely tied together. In the U.S., Britain, and across the Continent, there were a variety of Kantian and neo-Kantian traditions (Russell's rejection of Hegel was very much ""back to Kant""; the pragmatism of Peirce and Dewey was heavily influence by Kant and Hegel as well). These traditions interacted and debated with each other and often addressed many of the same problems. 

* The best case

In other words, the best case to be made for an analytic / continental distinction is that two different philosophical traditions came out of the war: one that was largely conducted in English, and one that was largely conducted in French and German. These two traditions then appropriated various philosophers that had come before them: the French and German tradition was more willing to adopt Nietzsche than Frege, for example. But that distinction still wouldn't account for many of the philosophers that are typically labeled as falling into one category or another. The Frankfurt School and the ordinary language philosophers, for example, fit poorly even into this story, and Hegel is a ""continental"" mostly because the Anglo-American tradition is less honest about their debt (and thus rejection) of him. 

I think a better, more sociological way of drawing the distinction would identify Quine and Sartre as the key figures and credit the divide to a perceived battle for the soul of philiosophy from mid-Century: a distinction born largely of the desire of American philosophers with certain pretensions to say ""I don't do *that* sort of philosophy."" As such, it unhelpfully jumbles together a number of different authors and traditions that often do not share positions and sometimes do not even share interests. If what we're searching for is clarity and precision, it would be best to abandon it.",Why the analytic / continental distinction--as typically presented--is artificial at best

**My question is, why don't we consider the problem of getting from phenomenology / what's ""in"" the mind to the world of social concepts equally ""hard""?**

As [Robert Brandom puts it](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-6962.2006.tb00030.x/abstract):

> A Laplacian demon omniscient not only about physical occurrences, but also about Cartesian mental episodes, need not be able to discern any difference between what is going on when the subject scratches a signature on a document one day before and one day after his twenty-first birthday, so long as it confines its attention to what is going on under his skin and between his ears. There is indeed a difference of immense significance-but it takes place outside the individual.

Now, to weigh in on my own question, it seems to me that we have hard problems (hard problems of getting from physical to mind, hard problems getting out of the mind, etc.) or we accept that some sort of externalism about the meaning of our thoughts is true, that--in some way or other--the concepts and ideas in our head are not just reactions to the world around us but are causally and evolutionarily determined by (as Wittgenstein says) that things are thus and so.

Now, in the actual lecture he doesn't seem to answer what I see as the biggest question here: namely, **how can we then have any contingent truths?**

If Kripke is correct, then any physical object could not have atomic/molecular/chemical/genetic makeup other than it has. All properties of physical things must then follow from their atomic makeup (this includes the stripes of tigers, the wetness of water, my blonde hair, etc.), which would mean that all physical properties are necessary.

Quick background: the Duhem-Quine thesis is the idea that the truth-value of any statement is a function of the truth of a very large number of statements in the language as a whole. So, for example, P = ""All bachelors are unmarried men"" relies, as a truth statement, on truths about the meaning of bachelor, the differentiation between men and women, etc. We consent that P is true because we are previously committed to the those earlier truths, and stating the P is not true would force us to rearrange a large number of other truths within the ""web.""

I've been out of trading about 6 months now and I haven't played the game much at all since then, so I figured there's no point keeping money in it anymore.

I joined this community back in June 2014, and I've loved being a part of it. I may not have made an insane amount of profit, or earned the reputation some have; but I've made some good friends and really enjoyed my time here. I'd especially like to thank the staff and members of the Alias trade server; I've spent a considerable amount of time there the last year or so and the community is so friendly and helpful. I'd love to stick around but I no longer have the time or motivation to trade anymore. ~~If you're the first person to read this far, send me a trade offer for 5k. Link on profile.~~

So, thanks /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade, it's been a great two and a half years.

As for the giveaway, I'm giving away **10 keys each to 3 different people**.

I've seen many people bragging here about how much they've made from exploiting these mistakes, and everyone seems to be ok with it; encouraging others to abuse the exploit before it's fixed. They deposit these overvalued cent skins and withdraw more expensive items from the site, essentially stealing money from them.

Why is this not considered scamming/a dick thing to do?

I've heard some people argue that the site owners make enough money that it doesn't matter. Between hosting costs, paying developers, advertising and general upkeep I bet the majority of gambling site owners (especially the smaller ones) hardly take away anything in profits. Even so, some of the more prolific traders in the community earn huge profits when trading; that doesn't mean it's alright to scam them. So how is it any different to 'scamming' these sites?

You could also say that it's their own fault; their mistake for entering the wrong prices, and that they deserve to lose money because of it. Well, often it's not their fault. It could have been caused by an incorrect price change in the API they use for item pricing; or market manipulation for the sites which do use market prices. Even if it is their fault, they don't deserve to be punished for a simple mistake. When someone accepts an empty trade offer; they get banned and usually receive a lot of hate from this sub, even though it' a mistake on the sender's behalf. Sure, the larger gambling sites like Wild shouldn't be making mistakes like this, but you shouldn't steal from them for doing it.

AFAIK posts encouraging people to profit from exploits like this get removed; but nobody ever seems to discourage people from doing this. Nobody seems to tell them that what they're doing is wrong. Everyone just seems to accept that it's an okay thing to do; and it's really not. ",[Discussion] Why does the community find it acceptable to screw over gambling sites?

It's called ***addition*** and is denoted by the + symbol. So, what is this mysterious concept called addition?

Let's say you had an item worth 50$ and another item worth 30$. Normally, what you would do is list each item separately. I found a much faster way of doing this, which is by simply using the *addition* operator to add the **first item's price** to the **second item's price**, giving you the resulting price of **both items**. I found this number by using the plus button on my calculator. If you have a different currency, it might work with that, but I'm not sure.

I listed a few numbers below that you would add to your items price to get the total price in keys.

5 + 5 - 10

5 + 6 - 11

5 + 7 - 12

5 + 8 - 13

5 + 9 - 14

5 + 10 - 15

5 + 11 - 16

5 + 12 - 17

5 + 13 - 18

5 + 14 - 19

For example, if i wanted to add a 53$ item and a 11$ item, I would do 53 + 11 and that will give me 64, meaning the total price of both items would be 64. You can round up or down however you'd like.

Sorry if this is confusing at all, I just got home from school so i'm a little tired... will try to answer any questions though (gibe front page)

> You must set a realistic and specific buyout or price for each and every item

This is quoted from the rules. I believe percentage buyouts shouldn't be allowed for the following reasons: 

* These buyouts aren't specific. Item prices on analyst and the community market can fluctuate daily or even hourly, especially for ST items. Buyouts can change after post creation.

* Clickbait. A lot of people looking for unique or specific patterns on low-tier items will often have posts titled ""[H] 3000% analyst in keys [W] Some unique patterned item"". Sure, they probably are offering 3000% analyst, but wording the title like that is obviously just to try and grab upvotes.

* It's pointless. I see no advantage to using percentages over ""X keys"". If you want to include the % of market or analyst, go for it; but I believe a key/cash buyout should be required on all [H]/[W] threads.

Feel free to discuss this; I'm open to hearing any arguments for including allowing percentage buyouts. Thanks for reading.",[Discussion] Should % Buyouts really be allowed?

I think it's about time to create a solid guide for fire & ice bayonets distinguishing fake, true and max patterns. As of right now, I don't believe there are any guides for these knives posted here. I decided to write this after seeing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/43g48v/psa_dont_use_the_bayonet_marble_fade_guide_on/), and realised we have nothing on this sub to compare to. [This guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/3pjz5u/psa_learn_what_a_fake_fire_and_ice_is_ffs/) isn't entirely correct either, and doesn't really define the differences between the types of fire & ice.

I understand some people won't agree with me; if you feel I'm wrong go ahead and make your own guide, it's up to the community to decide which they want to use. I've been keeping track on fire & ice bayonets here for the last few weeks/months, so I've tried to tailor this guide towards current standards.

*****

###Fake Fire & Ice

This is the hardest to distinguish in my opinion. There's a lot of ambiguity as to where fake fire & ice starts and tricolor ends.

What I propose, mainly for ease of identification, is to describe a fake as having **less than about a fifth of the blade base of solid yellow**. No yellow should extend beyond the start of the 'dip' in the blade, as shown by [this image](http://i.imgur.com/f9scirh.png).

**EDIT:** *There's a typo in the above image; should say tri-color not fake.*

I don't believe distinguishing these from tricolors is too much of an issue, as there isn't a huge price jump between red tip tricolor and 'least fake'.

*****

###True Fire & Ice

True fire and ice should have no yellow on the blade edge at all, but can have yellow on the spine. There should be no visible yellow seeping onto the blade. The easiest way I've found to distinguish this is by looking towards the tip of the blade, there is large yellow 'mark' towards the tip of fire & ices.

If you look at [this max](http://i.imgur.com/INJr4uA.png) as an example, you'll see that the yellow mark extends far beyond the curve of the blade, indicated by the bottom arrow.

**If this mark touches or extends to the right of the curve, it's a true**, otherwise it's a fake, as described in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/903hzB3.png). If you look at [this 'least max'](http://i.imgur.com/egGCL0b.png), you'll see that the edge of the mark is aligned with the curve, and in [this fake](http://i.imgur.com/efnrqBn.png) the mark is to the left.

*****

###Max Fire & Ice

A *real* max fire & ice is of cource, the 412 pattern ID similar to Karambit fire & ices. [This is an inspection screenshot of a 412 max.](http://i.imgur.com/S6GeZwh.png) [Here are some in-game screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/GPMJo)

However, this isn't the only pattern considered 'max'; a max is usually described as a true fire and ice which has **no yellow on the spine.** This is fairly easy to distinguish when looking at idle screenshots. [This image](http://i.imgur.com/YNSQ8My.png) shows what a max fire & ice looks like.

Description: Up for grabs is an awesome Seiko SKX007, keeping good time. The bezel is a little loose but it still turns/clicks fairly crisply and aligns with the dial perfectly. I love these 007's, just a really durable and pretty watch. Case is in good condition all around -- little scuffs on the back as expected. Comes with the OEM Z22 Seiko rubber band.

Undergraduate expenses  (3k, tuition, paid cash)
401(k) contributions, 5k
Interest expense on student loans, 2k

Usually it's pretty straightforward for me, but with the transition to grad school I'm not sure which 1098-T to use or which deduction to take advantage of -- I know there's one for grad school and one for undergrad, and my understanding is that I can't do both (and no software I've seen has the option of inputting both and selecting the greatest benefit).","To see a professional, or use an online tax-prep software?"

Description: I raffled one of these a few weeks ago to a very good response, so I figured I'd post this one too. It's in pristine condition, if there's any flaws I can't see them. It comes on the original OEM Tissot leather band with the Tissot Deployment clasp. Really great quality watch and band, and the deployment clasp looks awesome. In perfect working condiiton!

Description: Got this Tissot Couturier from Jomashop just a few weeks ago. It's a beautiful watch, and I really love it. However....I also just splurged on a Hamilton King Khaki Scuba, and I don't need two watches that each have the full day complication. Watch runs great, has no issues. No scratches on the non-reflective sapphire. Comes with the leather band I've got it on in the pictures, as well as a free aftermarket 22mm bracelet I got off Amazon for $30.

Description:

Raffling for a friend who doesn't use Reddit, but I have the watches in my possession and will be taking care of shipping. Both watches are in great condition, with only very minor scratches due to normal wear and tear. Neither watch has any major scuffs, scratches, or imperfections. Bezel rotates nice and crisply on both, and all functions work perfectly on both. 

The 013 comes on a bond NATO, and the 007 comes on a black. 

**this is a winner take all raffle. There will be one roll, and one winner will get two watches**

Description: For raffle as a bundle are 2 of the last 3 Seikos that I own currently. I've been a bit Seiko obsessed, and this get almost no wrist time. In this raffle is:

Seiko SKX013:

10/10 condition, worn minimally. Comes with OEM Seiko rubber strap, as well as the OEM Seiko jubilee that I bought for $45. Diver hasn't been used all that much, save for a trip to the Bahamas last June. Comes with extra springbars, extra links, manual, everything it'd come with usually.

Seiko SKXA35:

A friend gave this to me a few days ago. It's in pristine condition, even with a loupe I doubt you could find any imperfections. It comes with the OEM Seiko rubber strap, as well as an aftermarket yellow/black rubber strap that's surprisingly good quality. In addition, comes with extra springbars. 


**for this raffle, there will be two rolls and two winners. The first roll is for the 013, second is for the A35**

Paypal: ajp1848@yahoo.com

side note, if anyone wants a Seiko watch box, I have three of them. I'll send it for free, just cover the shipping. They've been sitting in a drawer in my closet and I have no need for them.

Description: Up for raffle is this gorgeous Seiko SSA231 with the desisrable Seiko Caliber 4R39A engine. It comes on the OEM brown leather Seiko strap and clasp. Watch condition is very close to like new. I can't find a single flaw on the case, crystal, strap, clasp, or anything. The blue hands really stand out, and I love that you can see the movement through the front of the case. Watch functions perfectly and is water resistant to 50m.

Description: Up for grabs is this beautiful Citizen Bl1250-55E from the Citizen Signature Collection. Honestly, this is one of the most impressive watches I've ever owned. It's beautiful but rugged. I've been using it mostly for outdoor activities and hunting/fishing. Due to that, the bracelet has definitely seen better days. The case, sapphire crystal face, and internal functions are 10/10 save for one small scratch on the case at about 5:30 (not the sapphire!), but I'd give the bracelet a 7/10. Bezel rotates crisply! Because of that I've hugely discounted it. It has a perpetual calendar, so it automatically adjusts the day for months/leap years and won't have to be readjusted until the year 2100 -- if you're still wearing this watch by then, that is. Second hand is bright read, no fading.

Comes with the OEM genuine leather 22mm band, as well as a tan/navy NATO strap that I think looks really good on the watch. The battery is newly replaced.

Description: Hi guys! If any of you remember, I posted my SNKN47 yesterday but had to cancel it because halfway through the raffle I found out that the crown was having some issues adjusting the date. To make up for that, I have this Seiko and another that I'm gonna raffle off! I've only worn this a few times. I kinda have a problem with buying Auto Seikos because I'm kinda obsessed, and I never wear them. This is like new in box. Absolutely zero marks on it at all.  

Comes with original box, original hangtag, seiko watch pillow, instruction manual, and warranty card

Here's the seiko link with more info: http://seikousa.com/collections/recraft/SNKN05

It's in near-perfect condition, with only some regular wear on the band from desk diving. It functions perfectly. I have it set on 24-hour clock, but it can be changed easily. This is my first raffle, so please let me know if I'm doing something incorrectly. I purchased this watch for $300 at Harrods in London a couple years back. I had two links taken out, but they will be sent with the watch.

Went back to it just recently and I noticed something I hadn't noticed before in all my journeys through Journey.

At the end I always thought it was sending you back to the beginning to be ""reborn"" or something. I was figuring it was rebirth because the symbol your character says changes, and I've always understood the symbol to be your dude's name.

But then I noticed something when I beat the game again last night... the little energy star that flies back along the path you took in reverse doesn't strike down to where your dude is meditating. It strikes down to where you find your first glowing symbols. So now I no longer believe that your character is getting reincarnated when you reach the mountain.

Instead your energy is being sent out to now be used by others.

This is supported when you reach the desert level, and you are exploring about. There are two spots where you can find a symbol but they aren't there right at first. Instead you see the mountain launch out something and it impacts where you find the two symbols. You do not however find two guys in red cloaks meditating when you watch them land.

I think one of the things that made me think that reincarnation was happening is that at the end you see the travelers you encountered and it's always shown as a Symbol followed by the player's PSN name, and while the symbol might change the PSN name is still the PSN name...

But then I realized, your PSN name isn't really part of the story. That's not the secret name of your dude. It's more like a movie credit, where it says the character name and then actor/actress that played the character. So in journey it's Symbol played by PSN name.

I'm not entirely sure what that means for the story to know that the red cloak in a new game isn't the rebirth of the red cloak from the previous game but I am working on something. Specifically what it means when you are able to be a red cloak that becomes a white cloak.",Thoughts on ending

I got curious if it would be possible to beat the game with absolutely no scarf pieces what so ever, so I skipped grabbing any and finished the level select tutorial area to get to the broken bridge.

Found I had a scarf dangling on me despite not having picked any up. Curious little fact there, but I continue on with my trip not picking up any and confusing a couple of people on the way with my dinky little scarf but highly detailed robes.

Sure enough you can complete the game without picking up any symbols along the way but the game still forces you to have a scarf in the game.

So I tried something else... I competed the level select area and got to the bridge and then went back to the level select area. Sure enough I was now at the level select area with a scarf length... and three symbols to pick up.

So there you have it... you can leave the starting area with a scarf length of 4, and finish the game with a scarf length of 22",22 scarf lengths?

What I'm curious about is if you have a character that has traits granted because they have a Symbiotic Life Form (SLF) in them, how do you handle this?

For example say you have a campaign where Psi powers exist, but for humans to use them they need a SLF implanted in them. If something was to happen to that SLF, then they would lose access to those advantages until they the SLF healed (or was replaced). They might even suffer from disadvantages while they have a SLF that's injured or dead in them. For instance, a wounded Psi SLF might make the host Absent Minded.

Part of me says to make the SLF as a creature, with it's own point value and what not. But there are just some things I don't know how to do. For instance the SLF might have cool PSI powers, but also have Slave Mentality, No Manipulators, and Sessile (It can only move where it's host takes it and if it has no host it's not moving). But for what actual advantages/disadvantages to give it that handle the link between host and the SLF, I'm not sure.

Also just in general, I'm not sure how to handle disadvantages that only activate in some situations and aren't always on. For instance if the Host gains the Disadvantage Unhealing when the SLF is wounded, this seems like it should make the SLF cost less points to have. (A reason the Host might gain Unhealing when the SLF is wounded, is all those things your body does to repair its self start focusing entirely on the SLF)

Couple of bugs they need to fix (like the photos of your pets you can take that result in your sim standing in between the camera and the pet), but nothing game breaking in that regard yet. But I do feel they missed some opportunities.

1. Owning a vet is like owning a store or a restaurant. You need the capital to invest in one. Fine I guess, but there is no way to just be an employee. I had imagined it would be like one of the Get to Work jobs. Ah well. That is what it is. Just sad there are no career levels/rewards tied with being a vet (though there might be special things for running a vet well, don't know, haven't explored much with it yet).
2. Just like owning a store or restaurant there is no aspiration linked with running a successful vet.
3. No new life state. I was so hoping that they were going to add in Were-Wolves, Were-Cats. Sadly no. I get that some people don't like extra life states, but personally I feel like every expansion pack should have one. Not a huge problem, just sad for me though.
4. It's all about Pet love. I know what you are saying, how is that a missed opportunity. Well because an expansion shouldn't focus on only one side of a story when they add a whole new game mechanic. There should be some pet hate too. Two new traits for being a cat person or a dog person? Why not have a trait that makes your sim stressed or angry when around cats and dogs. Imagine having such a sim go to a party at a house where someone has big dogs, and those dogs jumping all over the person because they want to play. That's a perfectly valid story to go with.

Let's talk a second longer though about life state. Personally I can see them not wanting to just do were-wolves again. But you know what would have been interesting instead but still linked with this expansion? Is a Shape-shifter life state. In their normal state they look like any other sim. But like the vampire can enter their dark form, the shap-shifter would be able to enter their animal form. Your sim's animal form would literally be just that of a cat or dog. No new CAS editor needed on top of Animal CAS editor launched with this.

They could have then let your shape shifted sim be controlled, unlike the regular cats and dogs that are purely autonomous. Then if you wanted you could tell the your stories about a shape shifter, or you could just keep your shape shifter in their animal form and tell stories as if they were always an animal (being able to directly tell them to move about and do what you want them to do).","Cats and Dogs, Missed Opportunities"

Obviously I don't want an Aspiration that requires the Teen to grow to adulthood. And strangely, I didn't find a comprehensive list with a simple google search.

So without further ado, here is the list I have compiled of Aspirations Teens can complete (with thoughts on their usefulness for a teen):

* **Bodybuilder:** The reward for this trait only helps Elders, so even with aging on it'll be a while before the benefits of this perk help. *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **Bestselling Author:** While a solo-teen can't write their own book of life, they can at least get the needs refill from reading someone else's book of life. *(Solid Aspiration)*
* **Musical Genius:** Never have been impressed with the reward for any life stage. *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **Painter Extraordinaire:** The mood paintings can be very helpful for any other goals you might have for your teen, as you won't be able to get those career reward objects that create auras. *(Solid Aspiration)*
* **Chief of Mischief:** Never have been impressed with the reward for any life stage. *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **Vampire Family:** I've not tested if Teens can create vampires with bites, but either way the reward for this trait only affects the vampires they create. Nice if making a big family, worthless otherwise. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Grilled Cheese:** While this might seem like a joke aspiration, food you can summon in an emergency is always nice... of course if you can afford a rocket ship to finish this aspiration you might not actually need the money to instantly summon food. Though nothing is to stop you from having a teen run a store stocked with nothing but grilled cheese... now I wonder how much they sell for... *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Fabulously Wealthy:** The reward for this trait is sort of nice and rather easy to get even as a teen, but it's also rather boring to do. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Mansion Baron:** Like Fab Wealthy, this one has a nice reward trait, but doing it isn't anything special. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Master Vampire:** If playing as a vampire, this reward trait is amazing. *(Solid Aspiration)*
* **Nerd Brain:** A very solid aspiration, if a bit pricey what with the need to own a rocket ship, but still those free upgrades are amazing. *(Solid Aspiration)*
* **City Native:** Doable but very time based what with needing to do something at specific festivals for most the tiers. Also the reward is rather ho hum as sometimes the vendors just wander away when you try to haggle with them. Also if you own an apartment worth $100k, do you really need a discount on your food that badly? *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **Serial Romantic:** Great for story purposes because who didn't know that person in high school that seemed to have a different boyfriend/girlfriend every other week. But actually a rather boring reward for a teen (More helpful for people doing things like a 100 baby challenge). *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **Angling Ace:** Sure you can do it, but to me it's boring. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Freelance Botanist:** I like gardening in the Sims, but I find the reward for this worthless. *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **Outdoor Enthusiast:** There is a movie about a kid that runs away from home and lives in the wilderness for a few months. This would be a fun aspiration for telling that story in the Sims, but the reward is rather hohum. *(Weak Aspiration)*
* **The Curator:** I've found that while playing solo teens, that I do a bunch of collecting to help earn money due to the lack of a job. The added sell value could help. *(Solid Aspiration)*
* **Friend of the World:** If you like having lots of friends, the reward could be fairly nice. Though if I recall right this reward is a touch glitchy at times. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Good Vampire:** It's all right. I've played both good and evil vampires, and I didn't ever feel like it was overly hard to get a meal as an evil vampire in such a way as to not ruin relationships. But if you really don't want to be evil as a vampire then doing this one is a solid choice for your teen. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Leader of the Pack:** I've never had someone try to overthrow my sim as leader. Discount could be nice, but if this is a generalized club where you change details to suit your needs (thus you actually needing all the perks) then you'll likely be pulling in so many club points the discount won't overly help. *(Medium Aspiration)*
* **Party Animal:** I almost never hold parties with my sims. Perhaps if I was throwing them all the time this would be helpful. I can easily imagine the party hard teen. But for me I would likely stop throwing parties the moment I finished this aspiration, thus defeating the purpose of the reward. *(Weak Aspiration)*

And that's it. ",Teen Aspiration List

Long ago magic was discovered shortly after the first caves were found with Powerstones, but soon followed a second discovery of Liquid Shadow. For years it was thought that Liquid Shadow was evil darkness incarnate, for often lands would be consumed by this strange substance. Within these dark lands monsters were spawned, that would terrorise the countryside. The world entered into an industrial age, powered not by coal, but instead by Powerstones. The ever threat of the Shadow on the horizon.

It was a controversial turning point in history though when it was discovered that Liquid shadow was not indeed evil, but a byproduct of the use of magic. This worried many, for it seemed that the only way to be safe from this threat would be to stop using magic entirely. But then a turning point happened when a young wizard discovered how to not only contain the Liquid Shadow safely, but how to put it to use.

It was a slow shift in society, but eventually having the ability to safely harness the Liquid Shadow in conjunction with the Powerstones lead to the technological revolution. Liquid Shadow, it turned out could conduct mana and so entire cities had Shadow Lines laid down in much the same way that one might lay down water or power lines in our world.

Comparing technology made in our world to the world of Noir Magic, much of it is the same though there are some key differences. In the world of Noir Magic, devices never really stop working when they are are connected to Shadow Lines. Instead they loose their luster. Light bulbs do not burn out, but instead cast muted light. Food kept in an old fridge doesn’t get stale, though the flavor does become bland. The longer something is exposed to liquid shadow the less colorful it becomes.

Of course these are the differences from simple everyday use. Should a Shadow Line burst this can be even more dangerous than a downed power line or gas leak in our world. With Liquid Shadow spewing forth and mana actively flowing through it, unpredictable results can happen. Older homes that have pipes that do not meet today’s regulations are often actually haunted, due to gradual leaks over time.

It used to be that people would have powerstones converted into inks of various colors, that they would then use to give themselves tattoos. These tattoos would allow the individual to tap into various magics and cast powerful spells. Without these tattoos humans simply have no natural talent with magic (Magery advantage requires complex tattoos). In recent years though it has fallen out of style to get these tattoos. With Powerstones and Liquid Shadow it has become possible to manufacture magical items, and the tattoos seem much less practical.

Each of the different colors one might get as a Powerstone, a different company controls the influx of. As a Powerstone infused tattoo can only have one color, such tattoos are often linked inherently with a specific company. As such it is normally only the high ranking and loyal employees that sport such tattoos. For a random person having such a tattoo it would be as strange as someone from our world getting a tattoo for their favorite computer company.

Unfortunately due to the color draining nature of Shadow Liquid, there is a distinctly visual class divide. The rich and powerful are able to afford bright and vibrant colors, the middle class wearing muted colors, and the poor being lucky if they have anything that isn’t dingy gray.

If a Noir Magic world has made contact with the Infinite Worlds, the leaders of the Noir World will both keep the public at large ignorant of this fact, but they will attempt to keep all visitors to their world unaware of Liquid Shadow. These visitors they will keep in only the most brightly colored suites, and away from the grey factories that produce the various magical items Noir Worlds are willing to export.

Magic items made in Noir Magic worlds in general are not enchantments from specific spells, but instead advantages and disadvantages with enhancements and limitations applied to an item to get the desired effect. The more common magic items are mass produced, and often take place of some item we would use in our world. For example the Noir Magic world doesn’t use fossil fuel cars, but would have cars work much the same but work because they are enchanted to work. Instead of having an oil change done on such a car, one would change out old Liquid Shadow.

Large magic items (such as cars) would need a Powerstone to power all the enchantments, and liquid shadow to link a single powerstone to all the enchanted parts. Medium size magic items (such as a refrigerator) wouldn’t have either a Powerstone or Liquid Shadow in its construction, instead needing to be plugged into a building’s Liquid Shadow line to use the city’s Powerstone. Small magic items (such as a mobile phone) would have a small Powerstone, and would not need Liquid Shadow to connect the enchanted parts (or would require so little as to be negligible).

For those magic items that have built in Powerstones, due to there being Mana in the environment they will recharge on their own over time, but often they are built in with the ability to plug into the city’s Shadow Line so they can charge faster.

If a Noir Magic world trades with the Infinite Worlds, they will normally only export the small self contained magical items, that either have no liquid shadow parts or such small and complex parts that there is no worry of someone in the Infinite Worlds reverse engineering it. If someone is recruited from a Noir Magic world the Infinity Patrol, they might have items that wouldn’t otherwise be exported, but they wouldn’t have an endless supply and wouldn’t likely be able to set up an illegal black market.

That is not to say that there isn’t an illegal black market. Even without the Infinite World’s potential interest in these complex enchantments, there is a thriving criminal underworld. One can be sure for instance that each of the Powerstone Companies have dealings outside of what the Government terms legal. Sometimes when people talk about the Companies, they refer to them as the Families when they are talking about such operations. While publically the Companies are competitors, it is not a huge secret that the Families have mapped out territories. Sometimes one Family will try to expand into the territory of another family either through legal or shady means. For the most part though the Families avoid outright conflict and war.

In regards to Tech-Level for the most part a Noir Magic world is much the same as our world. In some way it is significantly higher (Noir Magic is fairly good at implementing most Bio-Tech for example), but in other ways it is seriously lagging behind (As all tech depends on magical aura, and as their is no aura in outer space they still haven’t even been to the moon, let alone put any satellites in orbit). Things like weapons could be very advanced, but like our world there would be tight regulations.

Fashion for the most part seems to match our world’s 1950s unless someone is part of the wealthy elite. Then it would not be unusual to see them wearing something that could easily fit in with our world’s 1960s.

Beyond the financial social divide, magically created life-forms are regarded as valuable property. It is not unusual for an upper middle class to own a magical maid. Magical created life forms are always created with animal like traits, so there is never any confusion between a human and a magical (unless the magical some how disguises themselves).

Between the financially struggling and the magical creations there is little in the way of discrimination, as when you get into the grimy parts of the city everything seems “faded”. It is not unusual to see mingling between the species. Some humans and magicals even mingling on a very intimate level. Due to this coupling of species, some magicals are free citizens though the wealthy will often just assume they are still property.

Sexism does exist in the form of “This job is a Man’s job” and “This job is a Woman’s job” though on average both genders are paid the same. Often if there is a job that is regarded as primarily for one gender there is a related job for the other gender. For example while it might be a Man’s job to operate some machine on an assembly line, it might be a Woman’s job to quality check the parts coming out of the machine.

As mentioned before crime is part of this world, and in general the police turn a blind eye to crimes sanctioned by one of the Families. As long as public peace isn’t disturbed overly much the police are content to just let the world run. This of course has made some citizens unhappy as they might wish that a more attentive eye was turned to some matters. As such a popular job for Humans and Magicals, Men and Women, is a job as a Private Detective. It wouldn’t even be that odd for a small group to start up their own detective agency in a Noir Magic world.",[Campaign Setting]Noir Magic World

This is different than then simply using the enchantment of Shapeshift from GURPS magic. Introducing the Shapeshifter's Collar.

This Magical Collar is enchanted with one of a number of different shapes, such as Cat, Dog, Pony, or other mundane land mammal (sorry no Elephant Collar yet though). Putting the collar on instantly transforms the wearer into the enchanted shape. To return to your normal shape, simply remove the collar. Unlike other shapeshifting items that have been enchanted, there is no fear of wearing it to long and being unable to revert to your normal form. These collars furthermore ensure your new shape even should you go to sleep.

Warning to would be users: We are aware that once you are shifted into the shape of some animal, that you will not have opposable thumbs. We encourage users of our Shapeshifter's Collars to have a trusted friend available to make removing the collar easier.

Shapeshifter's Collar:

* Shapeshift (1 of Cat, Dog, Pony, ect) 15 Points
* Magic Powered -10%
* Nuisance Effect (Tricky for the wearer to remove) -5%
* Once On, Stays On +50%
* Breakable (2 DR, Size -5) -15%
* Can be stolen (Thief must make a Quick Contest of DX or ST) -15%
* TOTAL: 16 Points

As for the size, I wasn't sure what size a collar should actually be so I went with the -5 simply to have a nice round percent. Also as for removing the collar once on, the item is not specifically cursed. The wearer CAN remove it, but it's just tricky what with having no working thumbs. Player Characters wearing such a collar are encouraged to get creative. To be clear it is the clasp that is enchanted as that part is sure to be made out of metal. If the leather of the collar gets broken or the clasp just bent it can be repaired using non-magical means. The magic is only fully lost if the clasp is actually broken. 

For the whole stealing thing that is if someone is wearing the collar and another person tries to snatch it off of them against their will. Obviously a clever thief could be tricky and pretend to be a friend, remove the collar from a willing individual, and then use things like social engineering to convince the owner to let them hang onto it.",Shapeshifter's Collar

Turns out that yes there is and it's not even overly complex. In the Universe of Fable, there are actual Heroes. Not just heroes but Heroes with a capital H. The lore makes it clear that there is a distinction between the two. In Fable 1 there was the Heroes Guild and a number of Heroes in the land. Between Fable 1 and Fable 2 the world developed the gun, and this put normal people more on footing with the Heroes to the point that people got fed up of the Heroes shit so hunted them all but to extinction.

By the time Fable 2 starts, there is your self as a hero, and the three other heroes you have to find. There are literally no other heroes in the land that anyone knows about. And of those you are the one with the purist Hero blood meaning you can master all three of the traits that define a Hero. The other three are focused on only one of Strength, Skill, or Will.

But now let's be clear here... your own Sister in Fable 2 is NOT a Hero. Dispite you having proper Hero blood flowing through your veins giving you all the powers of things like being able to be shot, or fall from a great height, your sister has inherited the absolute bear minimum of Hero blood. We know this because she gets shot and dies from a single bullet.

We do know she had a bit of Hero blood in her veins though because when she stepped into the circle it lit up like a Christmas tree. Nothing so worrisome that her stepping into the circle caused the bad guy to panic... it was only when you stepped into the circle and fully lit it up that caused him to go all crazy and try to kill you both.

Now fast forward... the book. (Yes there is a book). In the book it's established that there is only one hero left and that is the King/Queen of the land (your character from Fable 2). And it might even be that they say that the King/Queen has already died. That's not a huge issue but we do know that Reaver is still alive and he was the Hero of Skill. Fair enough though that people don't tend to think of Reaver as a Hero though due to him being the way he is. As an immortal he does try to keep moving about so as nobody figures out he's immortal.

But to focus on the characters from the book for a bit. They are NOT heroes. They do tap into some Hero powers by getting their hands on some Artifacts, but they don't get to keep those artifacts. It's established that they continue to adventure as experienced adventurers but they are NOT heroes.

So brings us to Fable 3... Your character is the last hero (well Reaver is still about, but again he hardly counts). Your brother is not a Hero, that is why the Blind Witch actually manipulated you into rebellion because her magic sight told her that a Hero had to be on the throne. She doesn't actually care if you are a Good or Evil King/Queen. She just knows that only a Hero can defeat the threat coming.

So far this has only been a recap of the lore. No real theory going on here. Just wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page. But now here we get into theory. When Fable 3 first came out there were a number of people that complained that your character needed a magic gauntlet to be able to cast spells where as you did not need that in Fable 1 or 2. They were mostly complaining about it from a game mechanic stand point because you could no longer cast as many spells as the previous game. You had access to 6 spells that you could weave together in pairs, for a total of 21 spell effects. Things like slow time and summon monster were reduced to potions you had to drink (and obtain if you wanted to drink). But the book and Fable 2 tell us why that is... your character in Fable 3 is not a pure Hero like the King/Queen before you. You have only access to 2 of the traits of a Hero, Strength and Skill. Like the characters from the book, you need an Artifact to unlock your ability to use magic.

But what does this all have to do with there not being a Fable 4? Well the answer is simple now that we have all this established... there are NO Heroes left to be the main character of Fable 4. Your children's bloodline is to weak for any of them to be full on Heroes and you are the last Hero.

Reaver is well established as having bedded many people, but we hear nothing about him producing any children. Ignoring the fact that he's only the hero of one trait and not all three, I suspect his deal with the Shadow has made him unable to have children.

But even if he is, and there are untold number of rugrats out there that are children of him, none of them have strong Hero blood at all.

So there you have it... The REAL reason there isn't a Fable 4. Not because of any RL drama at Microsoft, but simply that there are no Heroes left in the world of Fable to tell stories about.",Fable 3: No sequel? In universe reason
3272,d73zv,20183,False,False,True,True,GeekyMeerkat,1456,GeekyMeerkat,79ugsv,2017-10-31 11:44:02,2.0,120.0,"So I know Fable 3 is getting older now, and it wasn't the best of games so this theory could easily be discounted as bad writing, but let's look at what the writing implies.

In Fable 3 you start the game off and you can pick either to play as a Prince or Princess. Even before you've attacked your first enemy you meet a friend of what ever gender you did not pick, and you are given the opportunity to establish that you both are young people madly in love.

Then the stupid choice happens and you get to pick between the lives of some random peasants and your childhood sweetheart. If you pick to save the lives of the random peasants you never hear from them again and effectively all you've done is erase your sweetheart from the game. Okay so let's go ahead and save him.

Well you then escape the castle because the king is just so insane and your character wonders about their special friend. Your allies insist your friend can take care of themselves and it's out of sight out of mind for a while.

You go off to a little camp tell them you want them as allies, they say 'Do a couple of things for us' You do them and boom you have the mountain people from the camp as allies, and the people from a nearby village. Nothing that took to much time...

You then make your way back to the town around the castle you escaped and again, that trip doesn't take that long. After getting in touch with the rebels they say 'Make a name for yourself'. So one of your quests takes you to go save a kidnapped person. The person that hires you says it's their soon to be spouse and GASP when you find them it is your childhood sweetheart!

So wait a second here... The last time your sweetheart saw you was in the King's court room, and they tell you now that was the worst day of his life. You are even given a chance to steal them from the person they are to marry. But seriously? Either this person thought you were dead or they thought you were still alive but just missing. If they thought you were dead then they spent basically no time grieving your loss. If they thought you were still alive that's almost worse because they took absolutely no effort to find out what happened to you before moving on.

Not only that but this sweetheart was dating a prince/princess and is now to be wed to a commoner? Something isn't adding up here...

I suspect that our ""sweetheart"" was actually cheating on you all along with this commoner. You were likely their primary desire, because as a Prince/Princess you would be able to insure they had a cushy lifestyle, and this other person was their ""I have needs and the Prince/Princess isn't putting out yet"" person. Your sweetheart never told either you or this commoner about the other. After you vanished perhaps time was being spent grieving that they lost their money pot, but as they felt that bridge was burnt they likely decided to marry this commoner.

Heck it's likely that your sweetheart didn't even know you vanished. It's likely the king banned your sweetheart from even entering the castle after the ""trial"", and as the King's got this thing about traitors he's not likely made it public knowledge that you've left the castle. There are after all no posters up around the city proclaiming you a traitor or anything like that. Nah making you a public image would just weaken his grip on things.

But ya, once you meet up with your sweetheart again they are all like 'If you let me come back to you, I totally will break this commoner's heart to be with you' and I'm fairly sure that's because they see an in back in with someone in power.

By the way, should you go ahead and let them latch onto your success again, what do they provide you for the rest of the game? Some special item or a unique quest line or anything? Nope. They amount to the same as any other spouse you might get. With them you'll be able to have children and you'll get gifts from them every now and then.

Well let's make some assumptions first of all. Let us pretend that you also don't have any of the cool skill up perks that would make things hatch faster, or produce that you sell worth more. We'll also assume that you always get no stars on the things you get. This will give us our near worse case situation, so it should only be able to improve if you get those things involved.

First of all, we'll take a look at how long it would take for a single void egg to pay for its self assuming you sell all the eggs that this void chicken produces. A single void egg should start producing 10 days after you purchase it and put it in the incubator. Each egg it produces sells for 65g, so it'll take you about 77 more days to recover your losses. 87 days? Almost three seasons? There might be better uses for our time... but what?

Well let's say you convert every void egg into mayo before you sell it. As void mayo sells for 275g, you'll need 19 of them to urn back your 50k. That brings us down to 29 days to recover your losses, so much better but can we do better?

Well what if once your first egg is old enough to produce eggs we start tossing them into the incubator. Those free eggs would result in more void chickens, that would then result in fewer days right? Absolutely. Turns out that what you want to do if you have the incubators for them, is to hatch the first 4 void eggs you get from your 5000g egg. After that just turn the rest into mayo and sell them. This brings us down to 23 days needed to get your money back. Of course that would require 3 incubators to pull off... and that may be to much of a hassle.

If you only have one incubator to work with, what you want to do is on day 10 (first day with an egg) is put one in, then wait 3 days (selling mayo along the way), and put another egg in on that day 13. When day 24 rolls around as you sell more mayo, you'll have your money back. AND it will have only taken 1 more day than the ""optimal"". Also I'm not even sure if the optimal is truly optimal because I didn't estimate the cost of the mayo makers or the extra incubators.

The point is though that for the most part once a chicken is making eggs it's effectively free money, and you can get to that point in about a months time after getting your first egg.",Void Egg 5000g recovery math

But I just watched the most episodes where Grodd baits the Flash and crew into coming to Earth 2, and then things happen and Grodd comes to Earth 1 with an Army. Grodd multiple times claims that he's been planning ahead.

Let's take a closer look at Grodd's plan though: Grodd captures Wells knowing that the Flash will hear about it and come running, but for him to come he has to bring the guy that can open up a path between worlds. This is exactly what Grodd wants so he can get over to Earth 1 himself. Great! so far so good...

Grodd also wants to be King of the world but to do that he has to have the old boss taken down. He knows he's not strong enough, but he knows he can trick the flash into doing the dirty work for him. It would be ideal if the flash killed the boss, but he knows Flash enough to know that's not likely to happen. Still though he tries to work it into his plan. Okay so some good planning ahead here, if Flash wins and kills the boss, Grodd comes out on top, if Flash wins and spares the old boss, still fine he can work with that, and if Flash dies, well he's never liked the Flash so another win.

But then the Flash and team escape back to Earth 1 leaving Grodd behind. How does Grodd plan ahead for this one? Oh wait he doesn't. He gets lucky and someone from another Earth shows up that knows how to open up a way to Earth 1. How does Grodd get her to open up a path to Earth 1? He uses his mind powers to force her... wait why didn't he do that to the Earth 1 dude? Grodd, relying on luck and ignoring your own abilities while using your abilities is not planning ahead.

Okay so now he's on Earth 1... and some how he learns who has the Nuke codes. Okay whatever he has mind powers, I'll accept that. His planning ahead on this one though? Does he leave some guards around the launch point for when the Flash shows up? Nope he does what... oh ya he and his army stand just outside the city... you know well within range to get caught in the fallout from the nukes... Grodd? You are suppose to be smart right? What happened to all those tactics you are suppose to be using? Where is your planning?

Whatever, Grodd you got your army and they are kicking team Flash's ass as they've got the numbers. And oh wait who is that that shows up? The old boss? Wait Grodd, why did you leave this dude alive after you took the lead? Okay perhaps you aren't strong enough but seriously? If that's the case why did he do something as stupid as fight one on one with him at this point thinking he would win? He has stated multiple times that the old boss is stronger than him and he knows he can't win a one on one.

This seems like a distinct lack of making back up plans. His planning ahead seems to be only this far ""Do X. When X goes wrong get angry and hope I get lucky.""",Grodd plans ahead? Seriously?

Okay so quick run down of the tactic presented in the video:

1. Chain 30 SOS Dittos in a certain way. The 30th and on will be sure to have 4 perfect IV.
2. Trick the 30th and on Ditto to attack an Alolan Raticate with hidden power.
3. If your Raticate resists it then the Ditto's hidden power is Dark. A 6 perfect IV Ditto will always have hidden power at type Dark.
4. Catch the Ditto that attacks you with a Dark Hidden power.

Now this won't assure you have captured a 6 IV Ditto, but it will at least cut out a whole bunch that you know aren't perfect. But how many will it cut out? Well when you have chained up to 30 SOS, you know that at least 4 IVs are perfect. The other two could range anywhere from 0 to 31 each and there are 15 different combinations of stats they might be on, so that puts us up to 15,360 possible dittos you might encounter at this point.

The rules for a Hidden power Dark Type are that all IV must be odd. Well this makes it easy to know how much we cut it down then... we've cut it down ~~by half~~ to a quarter. We still might encounter ~~7,680~~ 3,840 Ditto that according to this guide we should capture. Only one of those has a 6 perfect IV though. So can we do better?

Well yes we can actually. So when a Ditto copies the Raticate it keeps it's own IV's so we can actually compare what happens in battle when it gets it's attack off on us to rule out some things. For instance if you make sure your Raticate has an IV of 30 in Speed and is the same level and has no EV training in speed... then the ONLY Ditto that will be faster than him after the shape shift will be a Ditto with IV 31 in speed.

You can put your Raticate's stats into a calculator such as this one: https://pokemonshowdown.com/damagecalc/ and then compare it with a second one at the level of the ditto you've encountered, and set the IV's to perfect 31's. So for instance take our IV 30 in speed Raticate that has a 31 in the other stats... if both your Pokemon and the Ditto are at level 25 then the least damage a perfect Ditto could do to your Raticate with Hidden power is 6. So if you take less damage than that you know this Ditto isn't worth it.

Now unfortunately I can't give you exact numbers on how many false positives this corrects for, because it might be that neither speed nor special attack is where this Ditto's random values landed. Also as your Raticate could be any level and have any sort of training it's hard to say exactly where the cut off is... For instance if your Raticate is level 100 and you are fighting a level 25 Ditto, then if you get anything less than 2 damage in an attack from the Ditto you know it's not got a perfect special attack, but even an 11 IV in Special Attack from the Ditto could give you a false positive.

So ya I don't know how many of the false positives it removes from the list of 3,840 possible Dittos you might want to catch, but it should still be a significant portion if you at the very least do the math on what's the minimum damage a perfect Ditto could do to your Pokemon.

I'm having to build one from scratch and I'm hoping people might have thoughts on how to keep this easy on myself.

The specifics I'm desiring are as follows:

1) When the user clicks in the text box to edit a number if there is no number in it already it is auto filled to "".00""
2) The user may type in some number of digits. (1 becomes .01, 1 then 2 becomes .12, 1 then 2 then 3 becomes 1.23)
3) The number as displayed to the user includes required commas. (1,234.56 and not 1234.56)
4) The box acts like people expect a text box to act. If for instance they put move their blinking selection marker between two digits and types a new digit that is where the number is inserted. (IE: 1,2|34.56 becomes 12,9|34.56 when 9 is pressed when the selection is at the | mark.)
5) Likewise if the user presses backspace or delete, the box functions like the user would expect the box to function. (IE: 1,|234.56 with a single backspace results in 234.56 when the selection is at the | mark)
6) Other stuff that I may be forgetting

What makes the most sense to me to make sure the number appears properly, is to capture what key they press when trying to type in the Text box and programming logic for what should or shouldn't happen. If they press a valid key (# or backspace or delete for editing), it should not only let it happen but make sure it happens correctly. So for instance backspace doesn't delete commas directly, but would remove the number on the other side of the comma and if it turned out the comma wasn't needed anymore it would then get rid of it.

My thought is to keep things clean is to first strip the string of anything like commas and periods, adjust the position of the selection cursor as needed, allow whatever edit is being attempted, then put back in those special characters, and finally adjust the selection cursor again so that it's where the user would expect it to be.

The problem though is that darned cursor. Because the number (as a string) could really be any length, I need a nice clean way of knowing how many special characters are and were to the left of the selection.

In season 1 episode 7, the conversation of meat comes up. It's mentioned that man kind has progressed beyond the keeping live stock for food purposes. This shocks the alien and he says something along the lines of ""But we've seen you eat meat"".

It's explained that we create our meat with replicators, but they don't actually say replicators in this episode. If I'm not mistaken the phrase replicators hasn't been used yet in the series but I could be wrong. That is beside the point. What is the point though is that they explain how replicators work even if they don't tell us the name of them.

We are told that they recreate meat using patterns that are stored from transportation. The alien then expresses that this is barbaric but the topic is then dropped. Now it's likely that the alien was indicating that meat should be hunted and not just replicated like that considering that the rest of the episode the alien gets up to food based shenanigans but this got me thinking never then less...

The implication is that at one time the ship transported a cow and then use the pattern of that cow to create all the steak they could ever want. And likewise with a chicken, or fish or any other animal you might want to try eating. But wait... we see a whole lot of humans and humanoids being transported. Is there any specific reason that if someone wanted to try a bit of human flesh that the replicator wouldn't prepare them a bit of food based off of Riker's pattern? Or what if you wanted a Klingon Stir Fry?

Sure the series never suggests beyond this that there is any sort of cannibalism that has developed because of their source of meat but it does make exchanges such as this curious...

Picard: ""Shall we teleport you over using our transporter?""
Alien: ""No, we'll use our transporter.""

Could Starfleet be trying to expand their replicator menus by encouraging aliens to use Starfleet transporter? Is this yet another reason that McCoy doesn't like transporters?

Edit: As a few people have pointed out Star Trek is fairly inconsistent about what they mean when they say Utopia. As near as I can tell the Federation while having a number of laws boils down to 'Do what you want as long as you don't mess things up for others.' For instance they say that the Federation doesn't feel the need to go for material wealth and what not in one episode and then in some other episode they show individuals having a great interest in material wealth (like Riker with his gambling). This suggests even more to me that if a Federation person wants to try eating replicated human flesh, that they aren't going to get in trouble so long as they don't try to push their beliefs on others.

The problem I have thought of is this. In a 2d world with a time scale of ticks, there exists one single form of life called Bugs. Bugs are all a single pixel in size. Every bug has a color that is set at birth, and could be anything on the RGB spectrum, but once it's set it doesn't change during the life span of the bug. Bugs can see their local surroundings and how well they can see is again set at birth. Bugs can also hear their local surroundings, and how well they hear is again set at birth.

Every bug in the world observes their local area in both sight and sound and this information is then fed into their neural network. It then uses this information to decide what single action it will do.

1. It may move with a speed and direction, though this takes energy and it is stopped if it encounters another bug that is in the way.
2. It may chirp with a volume and tone, though my program won't actually play a sound, but other bugs will be able to hear this next observation period if they are in range. Chirping does not take energy.
3. It may try to fight in some direction with some amount of strength. It decides how much energy to spend that effects strength, and if it wins it gets a good amount of energy back and the other bug loses some energy. If it loses though it loses energy and the other bug gets a boost of energy (even though its action wasn't necessarily to pick a fight).
4. It may try to breed in some direction with some amount of virility. It decides how much energy to spend that effects virility. Unlike fighting that can happen with an unwilling bug, breeding is only successful if both bugs decide to breed. The ""mother"" is the one that has less virility.
5. It may choose to rest. Resting regenerates some energy. (But not as much as it might gain from winning a fight.)

It should be noted that I intend to have things resolved in that specific order also. So if a bug wants to fight a bug that's right next to it, but that bug decides to move, it gets away and avoids the fight.

After all bugs have acted mother bugs use a bit of their energy to work on growing a new bug. If enough energy has been spent on growing the new bug, it is born. Any bugs at this point with no energy left die.

So that's the basics for what I want to do, but as I say, I'm hopeful to hear people's thoughts. For instance, one thing I see is that instinctively I can't see why a NN would choose to have a bug breed as it learns because breeding doesn't actually in this frame work provide any benefit to either bug, and with mother bugs now just having an energy sink that could potentially kill it.",Trying to make a neural network

I was thinking about Stormtrooper armor and wondering about the purpose of it. On the face of anything called armor, you might think it's suppose to protect you from injury, but we repeatedly see Stormtroopers taken out with a single shot from a blaster, so they clearly aren't providing that much protection. Perhaps they provide some Environmental protection, but that doesn't seem overly useful as the Rebels keep on showing up in the same places as them without that protection. What it does seem to do a great job doing though is dehumanizing the storm troopers to the rebels, making it easier for the rebels to not feel bad about killing them.

This is rather interesting considering we know that the Empire tends to only fill the high ranking positions with humans, so why dehumanize their own people from Stormtroopers, to Imperial Guards, to Vader himself? Why help the rebels think of these targets as inhuman? Well let's come back to that in a second.

If we consider the Emperor, and consider his mode of operation starting from EP 1, we know it's to manipulate two groups into fighting each other and when those two groups get fighting he even tries to antagonize one side into killing the other. But again why? Is it just to gain power and become the King of all Cosmos? Perhaps but there does seem to be more to it than that. From even episode 1, we see he's plans for his Death Star in the works, and later after his first one gets blown up he gets his people right into making a second one. One might say he wanted it to be able to rule the galaxy through fear, but we also know the Emperor isn't an idiot. So it seems really strange that after his first Death Star gets blown up that he would try the plan over again.

But what other goal could he have? Well consider when in a New Hope, when that planet went Boom, that Old Ben felt the effects upon the force. And back before that we had that exchange with the Emperor and Anikin about overcoming life and death... so is it possible that the Emperor actually wants to create death on an extremely large scale in order to harness the force that is effect when that happens?

Stepping over to a fully other series just to make an example, consider full Metal Alchemist, and the whole deal with how the Philosopher's stone works there. The basics of it is if you kill enough people and harness that energy you might be able to use that to bring a person back from the dead... or just have unlimited power.

So let's keep track of everything that's going on:

1. Emperor constantly manipulates groups into fighting. As he's still doing that by EP 6 with Luke and Vader, there is no reason to think he's not doing that with his own army and the Rebels.
2. He really really wants a DEATH star. So badly that when his first toy was broken he started building another (actually given the time scale between when the 1st death star was built/destroyed and when the second entered the scene, it's more likely that he's started construction of that before the 1st was even blown up.
3. As he directly controls the Empire, it's ""easy"" for him to get his army to fight who he wants, but as he no longer has an inside man on the rebel side he just has his army be obviously evil (putting them in armor that makes it easier to think of them as inhuman). This helps keep the fighting going despite his claims for wanting to bring about an era of peace.
4. Even though he had a really strong droid army, he QUICKLY phased that out (having plans in place to do so even before the first Droid Battle) with clone troopers, and then rapidly phased them out with non clones. It wasn't just good enough for him to have people fighting robots, or clones fighting robots, or clones fighting people... no he wants people fighting people.
5. In further support that he gets some sort of power from multiple deaths happening all at once, consider how he took out all the Jedi. He issued an order that killed most of them at once such that Yoda noticed a disturbance.

I suspect that had Luke fallen to the dark side and killed Vader that, the Emperor would have instead of having Luke be the new Vader, would have instead had Luke fulling the war on the Rebel side of things. Much in the same way the Emperor was actively playing both sides of the conflict in the prequels.

Do we have even more support of this theory that the Emperor discovered a way to turn death of people into power for himself though? Absolutely. In the Force Awakens we have Snoke turning it up a notch. We don't know much about Snoke yet, but if he some how turns out to be something that ISN'T Force Sensitive I'll be really surprised. And what does have have constructed? Oh you know the new Death Star Version 2.0, Starkiller. Something built to kill entire star systems.","Star Wars, the grand plan?"

At first I figured it was an open world game much like Skyrim is where you get way points that say 'Go here, go there, now go here too' and to some degree it does have those way points, but the game seems much more geared to push you into exploring off the beaten path.

So what I mean by this. You start off on the plateau and at first it seems like it's going to be go to these way points but then fairly quickly on it's like 'Well no we are just going to describe what you need to look for but then you need to find it and plop down a your own way point to find it'

Okay cool mechanic but then it even goes on... Later after getting off the plateau, it was all like 'Go defeat Ganon, go deal with these four guardians, or go talk to Impa' and I'm all like, okay Impa sounds like the way the game wants me to go first so I'll do that and I'm sure that'll keep me on the ""main storyline in the order the game intends""... but again fairly early on with that it's all the sudden, ""Go find these places based off of these clues. Good luck!""

Sure I have way points for some things, but unlike Skyrim there is no sense of ""This is the order I'm suppose to do it"". At this point in the game I'm not even sure what I should be doing next beyond ""spend some time exploring"" and it doesn't even feel like that is wrong to do. In games like Skyrim or Fallout it sometimes feels like you are being crazy for just going off in a random direction to go explore. What's that the Dragons have returned? Well you need to go do this RIGHT NOW! What's that you want to explore in some random direction? Well fine but you still need to come back and go do this thing RIGHT NOW and we will always talk in a sense of urgency.

Where as in Zelda, it's like 'Ya Ganon's bad and we want your help as the ultimate hero dude to defeat him, but we don't want you just rushing into this. We have this plan with these guardian things, but no seriously take some time and get your strength up. It's okay.'",Impressive Open World

Quick about me: I'm a programmer, but I've yet to try to make a neural network for even solving a ""simple"" challenge, or even followed a tutorial on how to make one. So obviously I might have some misunderstandings of how they work.

To my understanding though the over simplified version of what a Neural Network is doing is it gets a collection of sample data, and it uses that to learn something based on that data. After it goes through a period of learning, it then can try to produce something that ""should"" look like it fits in with the data provided, but is instead of it's own design.

Now again, I don't know much about Neural Networks, but it seems to me that you could also put weights on all the Data you feed into your Network, where you say 'This is good strong data, try to be like this data' or 'This data is bad, try to make sure you aren't like that data'

Next up for my thought process, there are Vocaloids that receive a bunch of commands, and then output something that sounds like someone singing. Currently Vocaloids are just programmed by people, but it seems to me that it should be possible to have a Neural Network create Vocaloid instructions as output.

As input I imagine a musically inclined person could get a song file from some source and strip it down to just the vocals, and put that into the neural network, and that if the songs used as input as data had ever been uploaded onto a site like YouTube, you could even provide it the Like and Dislike data, so that the neural network can know if this vocal track you are feeding it is ""good"" or ""bad"" data.

Now as I say, I don't know much about Neural Networks, but I'm wondering if this is something that could be done with them? Furthermore if it is something that could be done, has it already been attempted?

I do know that someone tried to teach a Neural Network speech by sending it samples of their own voice as they spoke: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG-LATBZNBs

But new game really doesn't work the way I would like it too, and I'm sure some others would like to see some of these changes also:

First please give us an option to skip CAS and go directly to Manage Neighborhood. Perhaps I want to play a pre-made family, or perhaps I want to do some edits to the town before I even get started with playing any Sim.

Also let us choose if the Neighborhoods should come already populated or not. Same with the buildings. When I'm getting ready for a Legacy Challenge, one of the first things I do currently after getting my Sim moved into the right lot, is instantly go to the Management system and delete all the pre-made sims. Sure yes we all love the BFF household, but many of us also like to not see the same sims over and over again.

Please fix (more) of the hair styles that are in the wrong length group. There are a number of hairstyles for the women that are marked as long but look more to be medium or even short.

This might be tricky, but please have Sims learn just a touch of fashion? Pretty please? Right now it feels like when it's time to for the game to dress a randomly generated Sim that it throws completely random clothes on to them. But we already know that we can filter clothing by things like Boho or Preppy. Could they at least try to stick with clothes in the same style instead of just a complete hodgepodge?

And finally can we have some control over the generate chance of various Sim types? That is to say, there should be a menu where I can go and I can reduce the chance Elders will generate randomly, increase the chance that a Teen will be created, and perhaps even lower a slider down on Aliens or Vampires all the way to 0 so the game will not ""randomly"" generate them (they might still get generated due to specific events perhaps). That last part I feel is really important because I would love to see even MORE Sim Life States in the game, but I do not want what happened to Sims 3 to happen where the town would within short order be taken over by all the different Supernaturals.

What job that is of course depends on how you define BEST. For instance, if you want your sim to be the best gosh darn cook in the world, you may as well take the culinary job.

But let's consider it in a different way. Excluding the three jobs from Get to Work and the ""jobs"" you can do from City Living, going to work with your Sim is effectively waste time. Waste time being simply time that you have limited to no control over your Sim, and what will happen will happen.

If we look at it this way, we have a few ways of deciding what our best job is:

1. What job brings back the MOST $/Hour when you are at the top of the career path? Start-Up Entrepreneur (Tech Guru) at $516/Hour. Useful if you like to just every now and then tell your Sim to leave work early. May as well get the most for the time you decide to stay at work.
2. What job brings back the MOST $/Day when you are at the top of the career path? Diamond Agent (Secret Agent) at $4,260/Day. Because let's face it, how often do we have our Sims come home early from work?
3. What job brings back the MOST $/Week when you are at the top of the career path? Interstellar Smuggler (Astronaut) $14,868/Week. However a point to note is that the Astronaut career has daily activities that could kill your sim so...
4. What job brings back the SECOND MOST $/Week at the top of the career path? Investor (Business) at $12,992/Week. So now we are talking. If all you want is a nice safe job that brings in hordes of money, this is the job for you.
5. What job brings in the THIRD MOST $/Week at the top of the career path? Villain (Secret Agent) at $12,875/Week. The best thing about this job is that it only uses up 25 hours of your week. So while the Investor makes $117 more a week, they are also going to be working 7 more hours.

There are other ways even still of looking at the jobs to decide what job is best. For instance if your Sim is a party animal, you might care more about having lots of time off.

1. What job has the FEWEST hours of work a day and most money/week? Patron of the Arts (Painters) at only work for 5 hours a day on the days they work. With only $6,560 per week, it almost instead relies on you selling the paintings you make in your non-waste time.
2. What job has the FEWEST hours of work a week? Master of the Real with only 10 hours of work a week, but this also brings in the least money per week at only $4,920. You'll likely be cranking out a bunch of masterpiece paintings to supplement your money, so it's not entirely horrible. Plenty of time for Parties.
3. What job has the FEWEST days per week, and brings in the most money per week? Author (Writer) at $5,580 and only 2 days of work. Really it's not much better than Master of the Real, so you'll be relying on your books.
4. If you want lots of time off, but also want enough money you shouldn't have to supplement your money to much with outside income, you will likely want Start-Up Entrepreneur as with your 21 hours of work in a week you'll bring in $10,836/week, and you'll have 4 days off.

There are ways to argue for most of the jobs one way or another to show their good points, but there are a few jobs that are just really bad bets.

1. Diamond Agent - This job has the MOST hours per week at 45, but is only the 4th best job in regards to $/week.
2. Mixologist - This job has the 3rd lowest income per week, but takes up 30 hours of your week. Worse, you can't really use the associated skills to pull in more money outside of work.
3. Pro Athlete - For this one you work the most days in a week (5, tied with Villain), but you pull in less the average $/week. (AVG = $11,060/Week, Pro Athlete = $9,990)

BUT WAIT there's more! What if you have 1 main Sim in your house hold you control and a bunch of others that you just give a job and then let them do what they will? In that case I suggest giving those secondary jobs as Tech Guru because at level 2 it gives $1,240/week. Sure not much, but considering you aren't doing anything with those sims other than having them do what they want to do, it's likely the best you'll get out of them.

Now for some quick lists (with bad bets crossed off, and ones that appear in multiple quick lists bold)...

1. Jobs that earn more than average $/Week ($10,948) at top level: Interstellar Smuggler, Investor, **Villain**, ~~Diamond Agent~~, Boss, Management, Space Ranger.
2. Jobs that work less than average hours/Week (28 hours) at top level: **Villain**, Chef, eSport Gamer, Journalist, Start-Up Entrepreneur, Patron of the Arts, Bodybuilder, Comedian, Author, Master of the Real",Jobs break down

Most of it has been done by people before but then I noticed the Bimbiras from the THINGS section.

For those that are unaware IOU is a fairly silly campaign setting that takes place at Illuminati University (You aren't cleared to know what the O stands for). Bimbiras are an NPC creature you might encounter in your adventures so below are the 3rd Ed Stats.

Bimbiras:

* Move/Dodge: 5/5, PD/DR: 0/0
* Size 1 Hex, Weight: 100 - 155 Lbs

* Advantages: Appearance (attractive or better), Double-Jointed
* Disadvantages: Slave Mentality, Social Stigma (Valuable Property), Combat Paralysis
* Skills: Sex Appeal - 15, Administration - 10, Poetry - 8

> Bimbiras, while looking remarkably like beautiful human females, are actually a variant race (which does not interbreed with humans) that the ArchDean picked up on some planet - Blood or Guts or something like that - and gainfully employed prior to her *very* friendly takeover of the University. Most Bimbiras are in secretarial positions. Some also hold teaching positions in the School of Performing Creative Arts; they are generally quite flexible...
> 
> Students can flirt with Bimbiras, usually effectively, but are advised to remember that Bimbiras were once ""working girls,"" and expect to be given tips. They also love to work in front of cameras, which indicates either vanity, or some clues about their former jobs.
> 
> Since Bimbiras cannot be bred, they are reproduced by cloning. Occasionally a minor mutation during the process will result in a Bimbira who is actually human-normal mentally. Such variants are snapped up by COUP, since they tend to make excellent students with a talent for viciousness and a preference for black leather clothing.
> 
> For some odd reason most Bimbiras claim to have formerly been English majors, before they found fulfillment in their current positions.

And most of that translates over nicely to 4th ed just fine, add the Sterile advantage at 0 points and you are almost ready to go except for one little stat it has that I haven't mentioned yet: Damage: $50-100, Reach: C

Yes that's right the Bimbiras attack your character's wallets and not their health. So this got me thinking. Perhaps there is a way to make an Affliction attack for the Bimbiras that does what we want. I'm not to familiar with how that advantage works but this is how I imagine it:

Affliction (Earn Money): Based on Sexual Appeal to hit, Based on target's will to resist, Melee (Reach C), Disadvantage (Debt 1), No Signature (12 points per level)

I know that disadvantage is normally for mental/physical disadvantages but stick with me here a moment. When the Bimbiras ""attacks"" your character, she uses her sexual appeal to convince you to give her money. For the next Minutes * how badly you failed your will roll you feel compelled to give her 1% of your campaign's starting wealth. (AVG wealth in a TL 7 campaign means you would try to give her $150). Perhaps you get out your wallet and hand her cash. It might be you walk over to the ATM Machine and pull out money. Or maybe, you get out your smart phone and try to transfer her bit coins if your character is a computer nerd. For those without easy access to cash, perhaps they try to give her a gift worth that amount of money. And for those that are dead broke? Well they can't actually have the debt disadvantage so hey lucky them they lose nothing.

Furthermore in my mind to nobody would what the Bimbiras is doing to your character look like she is actually doing any harm to your character. Yes your friends would see that she is turning up her sex charms on you and if they have experience with Bimbiras might know to get you out of there, but for the most part your buddies are going to just assume you are chatting up the pretty girl.

EDIT: The IOU Campaign also has some special rules on starting wealth as your characters are suppose to be students who have most their money going toward school. So in this campaign your starting wealth is treated as 2 levels lower than what you sign up for unless you are very wealthy or higher. This means an Avg wealth person would start with 1/5 starting putting you down to $3,000 and also meaning that your character would try to give the Bimbiras $30. So in a 4th Ed version of this character it's taking less money than it used to take. Perhaps Debt should be higher.",IOU - Bimbiras

I know how to do that. What I want to know is how it works with the things from the ""Sword Coast Adventure's Guide""

First let's make sure I understand how Pact of the Blade works without SCAG's help. Say you have a warlock with 16 Strength and 16 Charisma among some other stats. When your warlock first picks up Pact of the Blade they can use it to call forth a number of different weapons, but for our example warlock he decides most of the time he'll call forth a Greatsword that does 2d6+3 (from strength) damage on a hit. Also you shuffle your spells around to make sure you have Hex on your list at this point, and now for the big battle you place that down, and now you are doing an extra 1d6 necrotic damage along with some other things bringing us to 3d6+3. A couple of levels later you pick up Thirsting Blade as an invocation, letting you take two attacks with your Pact weapon, so we are currently looking at 6d6+6 if both attacks hit. And finally at level 12 we snatch up Lifedrinker as an invocation letting us also add our Charisma to the mix putting our damage at 6d6+12.

And heck from level 1 to 12 we had 3 Ability Score Improvements and assume we are playing without feats, we could have put 2 of those in Strength to bring us up to 20 Strength (+5) and 18 Charisma (+4), bumping us up just a touch further to 6d6+18 damage with one attack. Okay now that's all good and everything but... let's consider SCAG's two cantrips of Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade (Green Flame!)... and both start out with the same thing ""As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack...""

So without taking either of the invocations into account we would be doing 3d6+5 damage on a single hit plus the affects of one of those two cantrips. One cantrip puts a mark on your current target and if it moves willingly it takes 1d8 modified by level Thunder damage. The other one affects some other target in the area and so while interesting let's ignore that for right now. So while 1d8 is nice it's not 3d6+13 damage more that you might get from having those two invocations in play.

My logic says both invocations SHOULD work still while using either of these cantrips because Thirsting Blade talks about doing something whenever you make a melee attack, and that is indeed specifically what both the cantrips require you to do. Secondly Lifedrinker says whenever you hit. Neither of these are actions or anything like that and seem to me like always on abilities when you take them. So if I'm understanding that correctly then we are looking at (4d6+10) slashing +(2d6+8) necrotic +2d8 thunder damage now, and another 3d8 thunder damage if the target willingly moves?

Also let's touch on ""willingly moves"" part. Where is the line drawn on what is a willing action and what isn't? Obviously if it just decides to take a step all on it's own that's willing while if someone use some knock back spell that isn't a willing move. But what if I use intimidation to try to make it run from me? What if someone uses a friend spell and asks it to move? What if someone uses a mind control spell and orders it to move?

In the game people are people and not animal people. The game just shows them to us as people animals because of the way Mae sees the world. She sees for instance Greg as a Fox because to her his personality and superficial appearance matches up with that of a fox. I think the only time anyone in game refers to another person as an animal is with Mae's parents when one of them calls her kitten. But for a parent to affectionately call their own child kitten isn't really that odd.

This would explain why later in the game you meet a group of people whose faces you can't see and they don't look like animals at all. Mae has no idea what animal to link with them and has no idea what they look like or who they are. So she just sees them as people people, instead of animal people.

1. Potion of Youth: 1,500 Satisfaction points by pursuing Whims and your Sim's Aspiration.
2. Cow Plant: Use it to murder Sims you don't like to get an Essene of Life. Requires Gardening Skill.
3. Age-Away serum: Learned from Maxing Science Career. Requires Gardening Skill but no murder.
4. Death Flower: More Gardening, good to have on hand but only if you have other sims you control. Does not protect a loner.
5. Book of Life: Can be used to bring a sim back to life if it's bound to them. Can't bind to self. Requires Writing.
6. Ambrosia: Can be used to bring a sim back to life. Requires Cooking, Gardening, and Fishing.
7. Whispering Wishing Well: Wish for Youthful Vigor and get positive or better results. Requires good luck.
8. Whispering Wishing Well: Wish for Life as a ghost and get neutral or better results. Requires good luck (and cooking if you got neutral)
9. Long Lived Trait: Not really cheating death as it only affects your Elder Life Stage, but it can be helpful if you've made mistakes and need more time to get other immortality options in place.
10. Become a Vampire: Depending on how you define ""dead"", this may or may not be cheating death in your book.
11. Cloning Machine? I know it can be used to clone Sims and I know that they do not have the skills, career or relationships of the original, but does anyone know if the clone starts at the same age as the original, or do they start at the start of the life stage? If the second, this could ""sort of"" count.
12. Cloning Machine! Even if your cloned Sim doesn't count as cheating death, you can use the cloning machine to clone things like Ambrosia or the age away potions.

If I've missed any do let me know. But this all being said, what's the ""best"" route to immortality if you don't consider Vampires alive? As you might notice there are a good number of cheating death methods that rely on having gardening so that seems to be a given. You should likely go for the scientist career track first as if you can get level 5 in it, you can build the cloning machine. You then just need one of the three potions and you can keep cranking them out. But mistakes happen, and perhaps your cloning machine breaks at a crucial time, or you drink your last potion before you clone it. I would suggest keep going up the science career to learn that Age-Away Serum. Sure it requires some rare ingredients but it doesn't require murder or the use of your Satisfaction points that could be put toward other more interesting things.

If you aren't a loner, I suggest you have a second sim working on becoming a writer so you can get that book of life for your immortal sim. Not only is it a great way to come back from the dead if a mistake happens, but it can be used while alive to restore those needs.

Now if you want to avoid gardening and science, it's still possible without becoming a vampire. You could even skip the writing. Just get yourself the Whispering Wishing Well and bribe it with all sorts of money before you age up so you can get in those good wishes. As this is effectively converting money into longer life, I suggest going for a high money making method for your sim.",Cheating Death in the Sims 4

That results in me coming up with a bunch of ideas that never get used. The past week or so I've been toying around with an idea for a Warlock character. Even went and made her up on a character sheet even though she'll likely never get to go on an adventure.

But this got me thinking about the various entities that agree to pacts with young Warlocks. So I would like to offer to you fellow players and Dungeon Masters this Great Old One that is ever glad to make a pact. The information below is presented from the records of a secret order that keeps track of the beings that various Warlocks make pacts with. It is based on their observations, and as such is prone to error (DM modification).

This great old one (as the name great old one implies) has been around for eons, and would be regarded as Chaotic Neutral entity. It understands that ALL actions lead to more chaos being created. No matter how intelligent a mortal is, they simply can not perfectly predict what will result from their actions. There will always be unforeseen consequences. To say that this being delights in chaos would not be fully correct as it does not feel emotions as we do. It does though feed off of the chaos that those people it makes pacts with inflict upon the world.

Do not be mistaken though, it does not simply go and seek out chaotic individuals to offer power, for as stated ALL actions lead to more chaos and so it is just as likely to make a pact with a lawful person bent on ridding the world of chaotic influences. Despite alignment not being a factor in who it selects to do business with, it does tend to prefer a certain type of person. It will generally seek out a young individual (anywhere from 13 to 19) that is unsatisfied with the world, and that desires to change it. It will then appear as a talking cat and at first pretend to be nothing more than a magical creature that just happened to be passing through, but that it only stopped because most people other than this individual can't seem to understand it.

In general while talking to a ""potential"" pact maker, it doesn't tell lies. It doesn't regard concealing the truth though as a lie. For instance most can't understand it because it chooses for that to be the case. It's fully true that it stopped because this individual can understand it. It just so happens that it also made the choice that this individual could understand it.

This ""cat"" will then spend a few days talking to this potential, telling the individual that a power could be awakened within them with the cat's help. Over these days it will tempt the individual with possibilities, but as an expert manipulator will never push the individual so far as to accepting. At least not yet. It instead will make it clear that the individual probably shouldn't accept the deal, and build up the idea that the individual could likely unlock the power on their own if they really wanted. It would just require time and patience.

After spending a few days fully getting this idea planted into the individual's head, the ""cat"" will put into action the second part of it's plan by manipulating events such that the individual feels like there is no time to wait. Perhaps monsters suddenly attack the village this is all happening at. Perhaps the building they are in catches fire. Any number of things. But whatever it is, and however it happens it is not obvious the cat is the cause.

The cat will then put forth the final offer and indicate that it can awaken the power within the individual, and that the individual will then be able to easily resolve the situation. And over the ages that it has been doing this there has never been a time where someone it has targeted has not accepted the offer. Though that might simply be because those that don't accept the offer get killed by whatever problem the cat has created, and so have been unable to share tales of their encounter with this Great Old One.

But why does it do this you might ask? Why the build up and then the backing into corner? The answer is simple. As it feeds off of the chaos that it's warlocks bring to the world, it wants them to think that taking time and patience to achieve some goal is not a realistic option. It wants the warlocks acting based on gut feelings and doing things that seem the best choice right now. Who has time to devote to years of studying the arcane arts when at any time you could be in a situation where you need those powers NOW!

Strangely though, even though it is a being of chaos, it doesn't just recruit hordes and hordes of warlocks. For some reason at any given time it only seems to have a handful or so of warlocks throughout the world. The exact number is rather hard to nail down though as while it does seem to prefer the form of a cat, it's by no means required to stick to that. Furthermore as a Great Old One it's not like the Gods with some fixed name it is recognized by over multiple cultures. The only reason it's known for sure that multiple warlocks serve it, is that warlocks that serve this one seem to have some sort of sense when one of their own is near. This sense even goes into full on recognition if they get near enough that they can see each other.",A Great Old One Offers a Pact

I've been rolling it around in my head all day and decided I would share it here to see how others might shift it to make it even better...

So here's the basic idea: A fountain with a large flat shallow basin is found by the adventurers. Think of those public fountains where people toss coins in. It would be shallow enough that if someone stepped into the basin area the water would only just cover their feet. Not deep at all. In the center of the fountain would be a statue with raised hands being held in a cup like manner. Pouring out of the hands would be a stream of water (thus making this a fountain and not just a basin of water).

Players drinking from the basin would find the water refreshing, but not special in any way. However various arcane checks and the like would reveal that the water streaming from the statue's hands is magical (becoming normal water as it falls into the basin).

The basin would be big enough that if a player wanted to do something with the magic flowing water, they would need to step into the water in order to get close enough (or get creative with flasks tied to 10 foot poles or the like).

Drinking directly from the flowing water (as opposed to capturing it in a flask tied to a 10 foot pole) would cause 2 things to happen. The first the person drinking from it is healed of any damage they have (Yay!)... the second though being that the water in the basin would suddenly become extraordinarily deep (deep enough a person could easily be fully submerged and drown in it).

I'm thinking that perhaps the fountain should have some sort of plaque on the edge of the basin that might give a clue to the players how to get the healing effects only without also suffering from suddenly submersion. But what specific message it should have I'm not sure on, or even what action the players would need to do so that they only get the positive effects.

Also on a related note, what's the average mindset of players these days if they find a fountain on an adventure? I mean for me, I would tend to assume any fountain I encounter has something shady going on with it so there would need to be something extra special about the fountain to make me think this fountain was going to be worth my time and not just some trap. So what would you as a DM do with this fountain to tempt players into drinking from it without being to obvious it being a trap?",Fountain Trap Thoughts

Here is my attempt to answer this by making just a couple of small changes to the standard person. People in the Kung-Fu Universe have slightly reduced reaction time with their fingers and are more nearsighted than our Universe.

First the finger reaction thing: You can still do your Judo Chops, and Swan Kicks just fine, but doing something like pulling the trigger of a gun takes a fraction of a moment longer than it would in our universe. This gives people that know Kung Fu the ability to disarm people with guns before they get shot.

Now don't get me wrong, I know that a skilled person in our universe can disarm a person with a gun. But take for instance the movie Rush Hour, with Chris Tucker. He is not some Kung-Fu master, but was able to quickly learn how to disarm someone after only a couple of demonstrations by Jackie Chan that he was able to do it in an actual combat situation. What I'm saying is that in the Kung-Fu universe, that the delayed reaction time with fingers gives Kung-Fu people an advantage over gun users.

What about the nearsighted claim? Well it's important to note that I'm saying this is the for the standard person. Thus in the Kung-Fu Universe, that's just normal and the optometrist isn't going to correct for it unless it's REALLY bad nearsightedness. So your average person isn't going to be wearing glasses, but compared to people in our universe they are nearsighted.

This means that when you are at a distance with a gun, you are more prone to miss even a stationary target. This with the delayed reaction time with the fingers means that it's next to impossible to hit a moving target, because by the time your your brain has told your finger to pull the trigger your target has already moved a significant distance.

But now let's look at Rush Hour that shows us a slice of China (Kung-Fu based combat) compared to America (Gun based combat)... Why would America have gone the Gun route when with these minor changes to the average person Kung-Fu is superior? Well the answer to this is that Kung-Fu just was never much part of American culture in it's formative years. Sure Kung-Fu might have an advantage but if you don't even think to look at it, that's not going to help you.

It's because of this though that in movies like Rush Hour, people like Chris Tucker are able to pick up Kung-Fu moves relatively easily. Even though it isn't part of the American culture, in the Kung-Fu Universe, our bodies are naturally geared towards fighting with Kung-Fu instead of Guns.",Kung-Fu Universe Theory

As the worst offender I point to all children and Braith. Braith is the child of two Redguards, but like all children in Skyrim she looks identical to all the other girls. Mods out there though that change her appearance in general try to make her (and possibly the other children also) look like Barbie's little sister.

Now sure perhaps the reasons Braith isn't a little black girl is that she's actually adopted... but that's still no excuse for her to look the exact same as all the other girls.

And it isn't just Braith and the children. One of my characters just recently did that quest where you kill your first dragon with the help of the white run guards, and afterword the guards are all talking and doing the ""By the gods, you are dragon born"" thing, and was extra disturbing to watch because sure it had multiple voice actors doing the Nords, but they actually had one of the voice actors voice more than one of those Nords, and they happened to look the same. So it has this strange affect feeling like I was having some hive mind Nords clones talking to me.

Admittedly this complaint gets a bit far away from just appearance, but if I close my eyes and listen to the conversation and there is nothing said that makes it seem like anything other than 2 people talking to you... what was the point in having 1 voice actor voice 2 characters in the scene just so they could have 3 people talking to you. It's not even like they had every guard have a speaking role in that scene. It was 3 guards and the house carl.

So while playing on my heavy armor warrior character, I was talking with a buddy about how I liked Skyrim over Oblivion in one regard because I always thought it silly that as you leveled up in Oblivion you would eventually reach a point where every bandit would be wearing glass armor or what have you making it feel much less special.

This got us talking about RL progression of military equipment and how as society develops new fancy things old stuff gets entirely phased out of use. For instance in today's military we use guns. Ages ago we used Bow and Arrows.

So let's take a look at Skyrim and see if we can decide if the equipment three specific factions use as their standard equipment makes sense. We can look at more factions later if people want. But the three factions I want to take a look at are:

1. Your average City Guard
2. Various Stormcloak Soldiers
3. Various Imperial Soldiers

We could also look at the Thalmor but I don't feel like it at this moment as the three we are looking at should be a good starting point.

So before we look at the equipment these three NPC groups use, let's consider their options. We'll mainly be considering armor but much of the same logic will apply to their weapon choice as well. To begin we must ask 'Light or Heavy Armor', and IG that effectively transulates to Speed+Loot Space vs Defense (at least until you get the perk that makes your worn armor weigh nothing, but we'll pretend for the most part the random NPCs don't have that perk.)

At this point neither light nor heavy is specifically wrong, and it's more a personal preference and combat style option. The city guards for instance, wear a light set of armor with a light helmet to protect their heads and a heavy shield with the markings of the city on it. Within the city this makes sense as if someone yells 'Stop thief' you don't want that thief getting away as you give chase. As for the weight of the shield in game, I'm not sure there is a benefit of using light or heavy other than what skill you level up passively.

But what about the defense, weight, cost of the city guard armor. It all clocks in at:

1. Helmet - 11 defense, 2 weight, 35 gold
2. Armor - 23 defense, 6 weight, 75 gold
3. Shield - 17 defense, 3 weight, 40 gold
4. Fur Boots - 5 defense, 2 weight, 5 gold

So let's consider some alternatives they might use. The most obvious that jumps out would be to replace the boots for instance with fur shoes or leather shoes. For some strange reason the fur shoes provide 1 extra defense and are 1 gold less expensive. This just feels wrong to me, like someone just sort of fat fingered in some low values... but sure let's go with what the game says. One might still not use the fur shoes because 1 extra defense for 1 less gold isn't that big of a difference. Realistically they aren't going to know the exact numbers anyway for the defense and the shoes don't look that professional. So I can see with them going with the boots over the shoes. As for why not leather, that would cost 20 extra gold for 2 extra defense. If you are working on a budget I can see that being a thing that they do.

But what about the armor? The armor has 23 defense putting it in the same category as Fur Armor, though slightly more expensive. This could be explained by that what the city guard is using is basically fur armor that's had the city's markings put on it. Really the city guard armor screams of cost cutting and bear minimum. And if you think about it this does make sense.

IRL sure the police have guns and bullet proof jackets, but not EVERY police officer has RIOT gear, and nor is their equipment Military grade. And in Skyrim this still makes sense. Until the events of the game, it's not like your average guard would be thinking they would be taking on a Dragon.

Okay, so what about the two military factions, of the Storm Cloaks and the Imperials? As this is a military campaign where you'll be sending your soldiers to fight the other army, and lay siege on cities, forts, and encampments you better hope that someone is supplying the soldiers with better equipment than what the city guard gets.

A quick look at the listing of [specialty gear](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Specialty_Gear) in Skyrim shows one thing REAL fast before we even start looking at the numbers. The Imperials have a wider selection of specialty gear compared to the Stormcloaks. So far this makes sense as even though the holds at the start of the game are evenly split between Imperial and Stormcloak loyalty, the Imperial Empire is more than just what's in Skyrim and is supplying their people.

But are each group supplying their people properly? Well as the Stormcloaks have less money for fancy equipment let's look at them first. And the answer is a quick 'Wow the storm cloaks are worse off than you might think'

The average Stormcloak soldier wears a set of light armor that provides 21 defense, 8 weight, and costs 25. If you recall the City Guard is using armor with 23 defense, 6 weight, 75 gold. This means that not only does the Stormcloak soldier have less protection than your average city guard, but the armor is more combersome. The reason for this becomes apparent though when you see that the Stormcloak armor only costs 25. It is extremely clear that the Stormcloaks are cutting costs where they can just so they can make sure every person that tries to join has at least some defense.

Even once someone gets promoted to officer in the Stormcloak army, they are using armor with 27 defense that weights 8. This is only slightly better defense than leather armor, and weighs just a touch more. So forget even the idea that Elven armor for instance provides better defense and weighs less... the Stormcloak army clearly doesn't have the funds to get all their soldiers fancy armor like that. (Well that and they are racist so even if the Elven armor was in their price range they might not use it anyway.)

But what about the Imperials? Well it's clear that they have more money. They for instance outfit the average soldier with either Imperial Light Armor or Studded Imperial Armor, both having 23 defense and only weighing 6. Though... now I'm confused about the Studded Imperial Light Armor as it's not better in any way but costs more. I guess that's the Empire for you.

Interestingly though the Imperial Light Armor has the same stats and price as studded armor. So for that price range that does make sense. But what about the Studded Imperial Armor, that costs 125... meaning they are actually getting a bad deal here. They should be using Standard Leather Armor at this point as it costs the exact same, weighs the same, but provides better defense.

But they do get a bit of a pass on this though as I just joked ""That's the Empire for you"". And that's not entirely a joke. With a huge group like the Empire, politics likely went into picking what equipment to supply the army with. Sure XYZ might be better, but get a good politician talking and suddenly the government is paying $640 for a toilet seat.

Now what about the heavy armor the Imperials are wearing? And the answer is no it doesn't. Imperial Armor provides the same defense as normal iron armor but weighs more. It admittedly costs a bit less, but as we just saw the Empire has a bit of money for silly purchases. Here they went the cost savings route when they shouldn't have. It's not even like iron is in short supply in Skyrim. Again this can be explained with politicians that don't really know much about war getting involved in the decision making process, but this is something that your military generals should be raising a ruckus over.

And who knows, perhaps they are. Perhaps there is some General in Skyrim writing back home to his supperiors 'It is absolutely silly that we are being supplied with this sub-standard equipment, blah blah blah'... we might just never encounter that letter IG.

This just leaves us with a few other questions. Such as, Skyrim has been here for ages. Iron isn't the only mineral people are mining up. Does it make sense that for the most part people are using iron and steel? Plenty of dwarven ruins to delve into for instance. Well first we can actually discount the dwarven ruins real fast because first of all those places are a bit taboo by lore standards. But even if they weren't, the reason we take scrap in game and melt that down into ingots is we don't know HOW the dwarves made their metal in the first place. Once you get past the taboo of the dwarven ruins now you have a very limited supply of metal so that's just never going to become standard.

Likewise Skyrim is a rather racist place even if you aren't a Stormcloak. So that likewise rooms using Elven armor as standard. Much as there are people in the world that will only buy American made cars and other people that will only buy German made cars and so on, you have a large group of people in Skyrim that would simply never even consider Elven Armor as a viable option regardless if it might be better.

We can also eliminate using Dragon armor as standard because until the events of this game dragons were extinct so no source of bones or scales. And even once the dragons came back it's still lore wise very hard to kill a dragon if you aren't the dragon born, so it's not like dragon armor is going to become standard for anyone BUT the best adventures.

Further we can keep using that same logic for pretty much every armor type in the game beyond steel. Ebony? Only one Ebony mine in all of Skyrim. Daedric? Require materials from an entirely different realm of existence. Orcish? Orcs lorewise don't share their secret smithing methods with outsiders, and so on.

So ya in the Skyrim region, it entirely makes sense that you'll have normal people using leather armor if they want light armor, and up to steel armor if they want heavy armor. People using armor better than that, either have more money than your average person or are skilled adventurers.

Interestingly enough though... let us pretend that the Dragonborn didn't resurface. We know that normal people can kill dragons, it's just hard. They would kill a dragon, and someone would claim the loot and what not. Then our big Auldin dragon would after a while resurrect that killed dragon. But in the mean time someone would have used the bone and scale to make some dragon armor. Eventually we would get a group of dragon slayers all wearing dragon armor going around putting the beat down on the dragons. Eventually dragon armor would start making its way to people that haven't killed dragons and a whole new market would start up. Because our end of the world dragon would just keep resurrecting dragons, the people of Skyrim would just keep getting more and more dragon equipment.

Over a long enough time, iron and steel would just no longer be the standard. Dragon equipment would become the standard. Even if we aren't talking about using their bones, Dragon Scale armor gives 41 defense and only weighs 10. This beats Steel Plate Armor entirely with it's 40 defense and 38 weight. A real world example of this is that we don't use Steel Plate Armor anymore. We now use Kevlar and other high tech polymers. Sure it might be harder to make these high tech polymers compared to just mining up some iron and smelting that into an iron chest plate, the benefits out weigh it to such an extent that there is just no reason to even consider iron or steel armor as a good option.

But hey let's say you don't see that as realistic, then our next alternative to using Dragon Scale as the new standard, would be to find a large Malachite mine and soon the armor you produce for from that ore would become the new standard and that armor is...

Glass Armor... crap Oblivion is more realistic than I thought.","Economics, War, and Equipment"

She's not some super hero or anything like that (though she does get a heroic moment in the movie, it's still not a super hero movie).

What I'm wondering is can anyone think of similar movies, live action or otherwise (or heck even non movies).

Specifically I'm looking for examples where:

1. The main character has some power (Such as Kiki's magic).
2. This power is used for some ""normal"" activity (Such as Kiki's delivering things with her magic flight).
3. The main character isn't a super hero (I've seen plenty of clips of things like superman using his laser vision to shave, or Mr Incredible lifting up a sofa with one hand so his wife can vacuum under it)
4. It's done in what feels like a believable way. (For instance Kiki is still a novice at magic, so it makes sense that she's not some super hero or anything like that and instead uses her magic to run a delivery service)

Before coming here I did look on TVTropes under there article on [Mundane Utility](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility), but I was actually amazed at the number of examples and through a quick skim through I realized most of the examples being given were for characters that abide by my first two stipulations, but not the third. So I'm hoping someone here sees this and knows exactly what I'm talking about and say 'Oh you should check out X as it's like what you are talking about'

I should be clear, it doesn't have to be magic power like Kiki being a witch. It could be a super power, or a technological power. Jumping to mind on the Tech Power would be Bicentinal Man, a story about a robot experiencing the world over 2 centuries.

EDIT: Here are some suggestions people have given in their replies below (some I've seen some I've not)

* My Neighbor Totoro - Little girls that can see spirits and make friends with them
* Big Fish - Normal guy meets extraordinary people throughout his life
* About Time - ???
* The Girl Who Leapt Through Time - Plot in title
* Time Traveler's Wife - Dude who has biological time travel powers not entirely under his control
* Millenium Actress - ???
* Wolf Children - ???
* Edward Scissorhands - Premise in title

EDIT 2: After watching all the following recommendations, I have concluded that they are NOT a slice of life style movie (or show or what have you) where someone happens to have powers. This does not mean they are bad. It just means that they are not a slice of life style story.

* Jessica Jones - Tried being a super hero, then became a private eye but still has an arch enemy and debates if her and her friends should kill her arch enemy. If it was just a case that went all season that would be fine, as I can imagine a normal detective with a case that takes a while to solve. But a private eye shouldn't be debating if it falls on them to kill the bad guy. No that moves this right back into being a Super Hero story where the main character doesn't see herself as a super hero. There is a term for that. It's Anti-Hero
* Chronicle - Starts off as teens doing teen stuff with super powers but quickly devolves into depicting how someone with super powers might become a super hero/villain without their reason just being 'Oh well I have super powers now so I guess I got to be a hero/villain.",Super Powered Slice of Life?

And while I'm not denying that it is a really good stone, it doesn't lend it's self to much variety. So this got me thinking about what sorts of builds would be nice to do with the other standing stones.

1. Mage Stone
1. Thief Stone
1. Warrior Stone
1. Lover Stone

So for these 4 stones, they aren't really ""builds"" per say but more just the way you get your exp faster so you can actually play the build you want. For fastest leveling you would of course get the Aetherial Crown, store the Lover Stone in it, then have one of the other three as your stone of choice, then with crown removed sleep with your spouse, and finally put back on the crown.

Now let's consider the stones that grant a bonus but no special powers:

1. Apprentice Stone - As the name implies this one might be good for a low level mage build that's having trouble having enough magic for the spells you want to use. Though if you are low level you might be better going for the exp stones anyways... get beyond this low level.
1. Lady Stone - This one might be fun to have on a werewolf character, as other than munching on bodies you have no way of healing yourself. For anyone else though healing spells and potions are likely the way to go though.
1. Lord Stone - This is another go to favorite for the Fudgemuppet builds before they changed their mind to the Atronach Stone. The armor rating and resist magic of this stone is in general a good go to stone for anyone unsure of what stone they want.
1. Steed Stone - For the warrior I'm currently playing that hasn't yet got enough skill points in heavy armor to get the perk that makes my worn heavy armor weigh nothing, this is a really tempting stone to go for right now as I'm constantly finding my inventory getting full really early on in a dungeon. But I'm not sure I would make a build based on this stone as both heavy armor and light armor have a perk that removes the weight of the armor.

But what about the stones with some sort of power?

1. Ritual Stone - Once a day raise all dead near you for 200 seconds? This can actually become extremely OP if you combine it with the Aetherial Crown. I direct you to this [ESO Necromancer Build](https://youtu.be/UosWerLthdk) for details.
1. Serpent Stone - Once a day Paralyze target for 5s, and Damage Health of target 25 pts... I'm not so sure of the practicality of this for a build. Sure you could combine it with the Aetherial Crown so you can repeatedly apply this, but you would have to open up your inventory after each application of this anyways so you would likely be better off with just using poisons if that's your thing. You can absolutely make more interesting poisons.
1. Shadow Stone - Once per day become invisible for 60 seconds? Now this I can actually see some solid uses for especially if combined with the Aetherial Crown. Sure you could have your character study illusion magic and learn a spell of invisibility, but this stone does give a really nice way for a thief/assassin to turn invisible without having to dabble in Magic and/or Alchemy. 60 seconds should be plenty of time to either fully rob a house or line up that perfect stealth attack. And as I say if used with the Aetherial Crown, as soon as you exit invisibility you can just remove and reequip the crown to have your ability to go invisible again.
1. Tower Stone - Unlock any expert or lower lock once a day? Really? What's the point of this? Aetherial Crown or no, I don't see the point. The only locks that are really annoying in Skyrim are the Master locks and this doesn't help with that. Worse from the way I understand it you won't be getting the exp from unlocking a lock with this power. If you are having trouble with locks you are better off going down the thief guild quest line until you get the skeleton key. Then just abandon doing anything for them until you get that perk that makes your picks unbreakable...

So summery:

* Ritual - Fun for a necromancer
* Shadow - Fun for a thief/assassin
* Lady - Fun for a werewolf
* EXP stones - Good for anyone wanting to level up faster
* Atronach/Lord/Steed - Good for everyone depending on what you need it for
* All the others - Not sure why you would use them for any build.

I would like for nearly all clothing options to be locked out at the start of the game, meaning if I want more I would need to go to stores from Get To Work and purchase them off of a mannequin.",Clothing lock mod?

Here is a quick run down of the plot is that you got these computer programmers that have created a virtual world, that I'm going to call World A. These programmers live in what I'm going to call World B. One of the programmers though learns that World B is actually a simulation being ran by World C and ends up getting killed so he can't tell anyone. Then World C's people try to make sure that World A gets shut down. But a question of ""Why?"" just rings in my head, so I'm going to try to answer that.

Firstly to better state the question, ""Why do the people from World C want to shut down the simulation of World A that is being ran in their own simulation of World B?"" I can understand why they decided to kill the one programmer, because it is specifically stated that World B was designed such that the simulated people should never be able to discover on their own that they are actually in a simulation. But that still leaves the question of why the need to shut down World A.

Throughout the movie the female lead tries to imply that there is a moral reason that World A should be shut down, however it's also stated that the people of a simulated world are indistinguishable from people one level up. So if World A gets shut down then that means every single person in that world would effectively be dead. Furthermore it's shown that both virtual worlds are used for the entertainment of the people one level up.

So here is my theory... the reason the people of World C want to shut down World A so much is not a moral reason at all but instead a latency reason. Sure we see that World A is being ran on a huge rack of servers in World B, but as everything in World B is actually being ran on a server in World C including the simulation of World A. This means that the world server in World C is effectively running two worlds instead of one. We even see the problems that's causing when the main character goes for his drive and gets to the edge of the world. This isn't the edge of the world, but instead an area where the textures aren't loading in. We can see this because the wire frame of everything is still there even though the graphics aren't loaded in.

As an example, if you look up videos of people creating and running computers in Minecraft you can see that these computers tend to run fairly slowly. Now imagine someone trying to run one of these Minecraft computers on a public server and the sorts of problems it would cause. It's not that the Minecraft computer isn't an interesting thing it's simply that the Mods of such a public server would likely need to go shut the computer down so the rest of the players could keep playing without problems.

But what does all this mean? So the people in World C wanted to clean up the lag in World B, but so what? Well it means that their priority is not in scientific advancement but in maintaining their entertainment environment. And that's fine but it also means that by their moral standards that only the female lead of the movie committed murder. Sure the ""bad guy"" from World C is said to have logged on many a night just so he could kill people, but those people are all virtual people. His society has no more problem with him doing that, then we in our society have with people logging on to World of Warcraft and killing monsters with your friends.

Heck in the end when the main character is out looking over the beach in World C, the lady's father waves at them casually. As far as he knows this isn't the guy from World B that's managed to upload himself into the mind of the guy from World C. He believes that this IS the guy from World C. This implies that how much ever of a monster the guy from World C is while he is in World B, that he is actually a well adjusted guy back in World C.

But the lady lead actually has the guy from World C killed while he is in World B, so due to the rules of this universe that means the guy from World B gets bumped up to World C. And right at the end of the movie the lady says to the guy from World B that there is so much she has to tell him... You know what that is that she has to tell him? She has to tell him how to pretend to be the guy from World C so that she can get away with murder. Because ya that's what she just did. And the guy pretty much has to go along with it too because what's he going to do? Say, ""Nope I'm not really this guy but a guy from the simulation that's taken over his mind"" Heck no he's not going to say that. It's not even like they can send him back to his own world. HIS body is dead.

But wait, let's take a step back. How do we know the guy from World C was murdered? Well first of all we know that the lady called the cop. But she didn't just say 'I think he's going to try to kill me come quick!' because seriously that cop was already really suspicious of things and had she said that he would have. No she went and actually told him about the fact that he lives in a simulation. In the context of trying to get a cop somewhere quick that makes absolutely no sense. But if you consider that the world was specifically designed so that people wouldn't notice that they were in a simulation, it becomes clear that when World C made World B that they put in fail safes. This is why the Security Guard that we saw just a bit ago was no where about suddenly when the guy from World C started waving a gun about.

Seriously these fail safes NEEDING to exist is the only thing that explains the Security Guard. In one scene he's super observant of the cameras and on the ball, enough so that when one of the guys in the lab forgets how to use a door, he's calling up one of his coworkers to tell him of this odd behavior. But when a guy is killing people and running around with a gun suddenly the guard is gone. Nope clearly what's going on here is that the fail safes directed the guard elsewhere for a time.

We even see other indications of these fail safes with the road blockades. They are simply putting things in place such that a person that is acting within the confines of the programming won't be able to get past. This is why the lady HAD to tell the police detective the truth. He had to be put in a proper state that he could get past the confines of the fail safes, and actually catch the guy from world C.

Anyways TL;DR? The deepest simulation is creating lag and problems for the higher level simulation and so needs to be shut down. While shutting it down a lady uses the situation to murder her husband.",[The Thirteenth Floor]Why shut it down

Recently a whim popped up to learn one of the experimental recipes, so I decided to double up this trip out to the restaurant with a date. We get there and about the same time I say hello to the host the diner's chef just suddenly dies of old age.

Nearly the entire first half of the date was then wasted with everyone crowding around the dead body as the grim reaper came for this guy. I figure at this point the date is ruined because sims just love being sad when other sims die even if they never meant.

Briefly I thought about canceling the date, but I figure nah, I'll just make the best of this. Perhaps I can plead with Death and save the chef at least long enough for him to make my sim's dinner. Sadly that didn't work, but after Death did his thing I tried to rush through all the actions needed to have a good date.

Surprisingly I got nearly everything done in the time left, with the only thing I missed was actually talking about the food we were trying to eat. Even that was almost a success to as I was in the middle of doing the 3 talk interactions when time ran out.

Still got a silver from the date at least, and I did learn that experimental recipe.

But seriously random note here... what is up with old sims and working until the day they die while at work in the Sims 4? I seem to recall in one of the previous Sims when your characters got old enough you could actually retire from your job.",Dating and Death

I get that a higher quality dish is going to give a better mood, but according to Carl's Sim Guide there is only one line in regards to price and the mood you get.

If you make an excellent dish that requires a skill of 7 cooking or better you get a +2 for 5h, where as if you make a food that requires 6 cooking or less it's only +1 for 4h. It's a touch different with gourmet cooking, but what I'm getting at is this...

Say you make Omelets for 8 once you hit level 7 cooking it's going to cost you $39. If you then level up to 10 cooking and make Tuna Casserole for 8 it'll cost you $60. This of course isn't taking into account the discount you get from using fresh ingredients. But what's the point to make a Tuna Casserole other than to satisfy some random wish that might pop up? It appears that it will give the exact same mood as the Omelet, so what's the point?

And if all we are talking is moodlets from eating is there a reason to make any food other than the Gourmet dish of Lobster Tortellini with eight servings costing $48 and giving a +3 6 hour Epic Meal Happy Moodlet. Sure at level 10 Gourmet cooking you can make the famous Ambrosia, but that's something you use for a very specific purpose and you aren't likely to be making that for general consumption.

Now perhaps I'm overlooking something here. The Lobster Tortellini does take Tomato and Any Herb where as the Trout Meuniere that you can make 8 servings of at level 9 for $78 and takes a Trout, Lemon, and Parsley. Perhaps with the price reduction you get for having all fresh ingredients the Trout Meuniere costs less than the Lobster Tortellini does with all fresh ingredients. But even then, I'm just not sure I think it's that great of a deal. I've never done much with fishing but I do know that a specific fish is going to be harder to get than two crops you can grow in your own yard.

And of course if you are making these meals to sell using the Get to Work's retail I can see the benefit selling Trout Meuniere instead of Lobster Tortellini. But if we are talking about just for eating, do I understand correctly that the Lobster Tortellini is actually the ""best"" standard food in the game?",Reason for expensive food?

The second type of answer is ""put your points in the stats that help your main professions"" while not actually providing any proper advise beyond that. So while helpful it's in that not really answering the question helpful answer.

That brings us to my advice for anyone creating a new character, and wanting to play the game at their own pace. First of all what you really need to know is that the story line of the game is extremely easy. Multiple people have played through and beat the game without even killing anything, and not even using exploits. But I'm going to assume that if you are reading this you are thinking right now ""But I want to go kill monsters!""

As you should be aware there are 4 combat professions, but I'm only going to only be giving 3 builds because 2 of the combat professions use basically the same stats to do well in.

**Build 1: Close Combat (Heavy Crafting)**

Evenly split your points between Strength and Vitality, and when out fighting monsters play as either a Paladin or Mercenary. Also pick up the secondary Lives of Blacksmith, Miner, Carpenter, and Woodcutter. You'll be able to make all of your own equipment nice and easily, even getting the raw materials for it yourself. When you are a Paladin you won't hit as hard as you will while playing a Mercenary, but you'll have a bit more defense from your shield.

This is a great build for a 1st time player because once you reach the end game stuff and are thinking of resetting your stats to try a different build, you'll be able to make all the top of the line equipment you'll want or need once you do that reset. (For instance making a collection of magic wands to use later when you want to play as a magic user and start leveling up your ability to use better wands)

**Build 2: Wizard (Light Crafting)**

For this build you'll want to evenly split your points between Intelligence and Dexterity. Obviously when you are out fighting monsters you'll be using the Wizard life, but you'll also want to pick up Tailoring and Alchemy. With these two professions you'll be making all your fancy wizard robes and interesting accessories. Sadly your ability to progress in the Carpenter life will be limited, so you aren't likely to be making your own wands while using this build. Your options in that regard are to either buy them from NPCs, get them from a friend who is using Build 1 or some other carpentry based build, or perhaps you have beat the game and you are coming into this life from Build 1. In that case all your wands you'll end up using should be sitting in your wardrobe waiting for you to get better at your magic.

This build is I would say a medium difficulty build as you'll unless you have a source of those wands you'll only be using basic weapons instead of top quality.

**Build 3: Hunter (Living off the land)**

Finally for this build you'll be evenly splitting your points between Dexterity and Focus. For your fighting style you'll want to play as a Hunter shooting your enemy with your bow. You'll be picking up tailoring, fishing, and cooking as your secondary lives. You could use the clothing you craft with tailoring but you might find it better to buy the various leather armors from the NPCs.

This build is the hardest of the three to play as, because for the most part you'll need to rely on the loot you find out while adventuring or purchase from merchants. But don't worry, money should never be a big problem for you. With fishing and cooking you can make some rather nice meals that the merchants pay good money for. Also once you get your cooking up high enough you'll be able to start making candy. We'll come back to that in a moment.

**Maxed Stats Now What?**

So if you don't have the DLC it won't be long before the two stats you were leveling up get maxed out as they can only go up to 50 a piece. But where to put all your new points coming in? My suggestion is to pick a third stat and split the points between this and luck. The one downside with all three of these builds is that as none of them have luck you'll find rare drops are sometimes annoyingly rare. But what stat to pick to pair with luck? Well that depends on what build you picked and what you think you might like to try doing next. My suggestion is to look at one of the crafting professions that your build isn't suited for, and start leveling up in the primary stat for that. For instance if you wanted to start dabbling in alchemy with the Close Combat build, you would start leveling up intelligence and luck. If on the other hand you wanted to start learning to cook you would take Focus and Luck. (Honestly if you want to be able to make candy you'll likely need both the primary stat and the two secondary stats for cooking being leveled up but that's late game stuff anyways, so you'll have beat the game by then and can respect to have the perfect cook build if you want)

**Let's talk candy**

So I keep talking about candy. But what is it? No I'm not talking about Pam's Candy though that is some good candy. I'm glad I ate mine right away when she gave it to me. No I'm talking about Stat Candy that's introduced in the DLC. There is a different type of candy for each stat, and eating a single piece of candy raises one of your stats by 1 point permanently. That is to say when you reset your stats that stat candy will still be in place. Furthermore you can only eat 100 total pieces of it, and it doesn't raise a stat above max. But what it does do is save you those stat points to put elsewhere.

So what stat candies SHOULD you even eat? Well there are a few different schools of thought on this:

1. Eat 95 Luck Candies and then 1 each of the other stats. Now your base stats right after a respect will be 6/6/6/6/6/100. The logic here is that luck helps out all lives in some way. It helps rare items drop more often, you are more likely to get top quality crafting done and blah blah blah. It does though have a down side though that is really strange. Because rare drops are more common with high luck, this means common drops are less common. I'm fairly sure at this point in the game any common item you might want you should be able to get from a merchant somewhere, but I do think there are a couple of common items in the game that aren't sold by merchants and also become effectively rare with max luck. I though can not point to a specific example.
2. Eat 20 of each candy excluding the luck candy. Now your base stats are 25/25/25/25/25/5. This is good for a nice general purpose build that doesn't care about luck or wants to be able to set luck to a specific value so as to find that sweet spot where rare items can be found but that those ultra common items don't get bumped off the loot table entirely. The downside of this build is that if you do decide to max out luck with your stat points, the rest can be strained to get high enough to be truly effective post-end game. At least until you reach max level.
3. Eat 16 of all the different candies and then 4 more luck candies. Your base stats will now be 21/21/21/21/21/25. This gives you the best of both worlds as now your base luck is good enough you should have a bit of an easier time getting those rare drops, but also if you decide you need it higher you still have a good number of points to max out the stats you need for a specific life.

And there you have it, 3 nice solid builds to take you through the Pre-DLC storyline while having plenty of fun, then 3 candy spreads you might consider once you reach that point. Last little bit of advice on your stats: resetting stats is expensive, but as long as whatever build you are currently trying includes either Vitality, Intelligence, or Focus you should be able to use one of the crafting professions to pull in money relatively quickly to do another reset.",Double Stat Builds (and later Candy)

That's not what I want to talk about yet... I want to talk about the Delos Globe seen when they are first walking through Cold Storage.

It's this huge sculpture and the lay out of the area doesn't look like a basement area at all, but instead that of a Lobby for some business that's been out of service for a number of years.

This instantly made me think of Portal 2 where you end up at the bottom of a deep mine and find that the Science facility just building new structures right on top of the old stuff and then promptly forgetting about all the old stuff.

If we look at the Westworld wiki we see that it looks like something similar has happened here, with the area right above cold storage being marked as Old Disused Facilities. But what's actually happened here? I get that with improved tech you might just build a new facility instead of trying to upgrade an old facility, but that's not what happened here exactly. What they did was convert the old facility entirely into a new purpose (cold storage). But why? As they were building all new faculties anyway, why not build a brand new cold storage if they felt the need to have a cold storage at all.

Seriously, cold storage makes absolutely no sense the more I think about it:

1. They show us one of Ford's Machines making a brand new host and he says that this one isn't as fast as the ones in the facility. So this tells us that they ARE able to make new hosts.
2. From the Wiki we can see that sometimes a host gets so damaged they just have to do a full body rebuild where they pull out it's core and put it in a new body. So this tells us that they can recreate SPECIFIC bodies.
3. The only thing they seemingly can't recreate is the specific mind of a host, so it seems sort of understandable they might want to keep a back up of old hosts when they retire them... but...
4. They show us that with at least some of the hosts they put in cold storage they do this little drill thing that basically lobotomizes the host. So they aren't even really keeping the mind but instead just the body (that we've already seen that they can easily replace both with entirely different bodies, or identical bodies.
5. They do this all in an old facility that for the most part remains unused except for this one area, when it's clear that they built a whole new facility and could have put a cold storage in there if they felt they needed one at all.

It just seems so odd to me that they are doing something they apparently don't even need to be doing in a facility they aren't even using anyways.",Cold Storage Confusion

They are all standing around the table with all their actions canceled and there food unfinished and either sitting on the table where the sims left it or on the floor where the sim just moments before was walking.

Not sure what's going on because it's not every sim in the lot that gets a canceled action, just those involved in the act of eating. And it's really annoying because once it happens it's likely to keep happening so it's really frustrating getting your sims to finish their meals.

I'm not the best at the game so I'm only up to about a week of survival before something stupid happens.

But to be clear what do I mean by pacifist... No killing zombies obviously but also no pushing them... so no pushing them into a room and then closing the door. If I can get them in a room without touching them then ya I can close the door to try to keep them in, but I can't physically force the zombies to do things.

I'll be playing on the First Week Hardcore as that's what I normally play on. My starting city will be Muldraugh and for my traits I'm going with:

* Cowardly
* Hypochondriac
* Slow Reader
* Hemophobic
* Weak Stomach
* Pacifist
* High Thirst
* Slow Healer
* Thin-Skinned
* Fitness Instructor
* Dexterous
* Outdoorsman
* Graceful
* Lucky
* Runner
* Fit
* Organized

As an added challenge, I start my characters out naked, and hope I find clothes in the house I start in, but if they aren't there then I will go out into the world wearing nothing but underwear.

EDIT: So first character didn't live long, but not from any fault on my part. I ran around looting a few houses going in quick and grabbing only those things I thought I might need right away and getting out before the zombies broke any windows or doors. Made my way randomly to the farmhouse near the train station and thought I had a good idea for how to live. I would clear out the house of the three zombies inside by yelling and leading them away. With my really fast sprinting it wouldn't be hard to loop around back to the farm house and let them wander to the main town.

After clearing out the farm house in this manner I was looking around to see what loot I had to find when suddenly I glitched through the second story floor and broke my leg. At that point I just quit because my whole tactic for staying alive with this character was running faster than any of the zombies, and while a character with a proper base set up could perhaps splint their leg and wait it out while it heals, having that happen on day 1 was as good as a death sentence.

EDIT 2: Might have to let myself push zombies as long as it's just to get them off of me. Happened to get to close to a SINGLE zombie and because I wouldn't let myself push it I just couldn't get away from it to run and it bit me.

Well as I look at the raffle right this second, during the previous hour 3110 people entered and only 13 people won. It tends to always be similar sorts of numbers, so for simple math let's say 3000 people enter on average and 10 people win on average. This means if you enter only once you have about a 0.3% chance of winning assuming it's fair. Similarly this means you have a 99.7% chance you will not win.

But what are the chances that you will never win? Well that depends on how many times you enter the raffle. We can figure that out by by taking .997 to the power of the number of times we enter. Likewise if we subtract that result from 1 we get the chance that we win at least once in all that time.

If we graph both at once right where these two curves intersect will be where we have a 50% chance of having always lost or having one at least once. And where that happens is at about the 231 mark (230.7 something). But again for easy math let's call it 240. This rounding has created less than a 2% difference between the two, and that should be fine.

So what that means is if you skipped sleeping or shared your phone with a friend so you two could sleep in shifts or any number of things that you could in theory have a 50% chance of winning after 10 days of entering every hour.

But okay that's unrealistic to expect that you skip sleeping for 10 days just to get a 50% chance of winning at least once, so what if we assume you sleep for 8 hours a day but that while you are awake you enter every hour. That means you only enter 16 times in one day, and that ups the number of days to get us to 50% to 15 days.

But let's say you aren't obsessed with tiny tower, and so on any given day you only enter 8 times. That raises the day count up to a full month just to have a 50% chance of having won the raffle a single time.

But I know, 50% chance isn't all that good. We all know in video games like Fallout that if the game tells you that you have a 80% chance to hit something that is as good as a miss.

No no, we want our sure thing. Our 95% chance of having hit the target... or in our case having won the raffle at least one time. That happens at just shy of 1000 (997.1) attempts at the raffle. Again in our TOTALLY obsessed no sleep terms that's  42 days of playing every hour. In our sleep is aloud terms that's just over 2 months. And finally for our casual player, that's over 4 months. Just to win at least once.

Of course that is all assuming the raffle is fair. There are indications that is NOT fair, as I have heard of people winning multiple times in a row. This isn't so much a complaint but an observation about the games ""randomness"" where it gets locked into the idea that you are suppose to get something and so keeps giving it to you despite you having literally just got it. I've had it give me the exact same VIP until my entire lobby was full in a matter of minutes. So I've seen this behavior from the game.

My only suggestion for you on the raffle is enter often and if you win make sure you enter again as soon as you can in the hopes the game still thinks you are part of the winning group.",Some Raffle Math

* More clothing choices (not just the blouse/shirt/sweater and pants/skirt option we have currently)
* Clothing states: Ragged, Foul, Dirty, Worn, and Clean (see below for how I would have each of these states work)
* More traits both positive and negative (see below for a few I think might be fun)
* Better beds (We find all these pillows and sheets... let's have the beds use them)
* Animals: Running through the forest to avoid zombies? Did you know Kentucky has a bear, coyote, and fox population?
* More ""flavor"" stuff. (Stuff like sometimes you walk into a house to find a dead body with a bunch of bleach around it. Perhaps dead bodies with journals on them that have a stuff in them like 'Was scratched. If you are reading this then I'm dead. If you find a man named Frank tell him he won the bet')

As for the clothing thing, the way I see it is that when you start the game your clothes are clean. Most the clothes you find in dressers or in clothing stores would also be clean. Wear the same outfit for a while and it goes to a worn state. Keep wearing it and it eventually gets dirty. Even more beyond that and they get foul. Get hurt in an area where clothing is covering and that big of clothing becomes ragged. Doing lots of activity would also push the clothes along faster toward the dirty state (running from one town to another without stopping or getting in lots of fights regardless of if you get hurt).

Okay now clean clothes are the ideal state. When they get to worn they are just a touch pungent and zombies are better able to smell you. Don't worry though, going from worn to ""clean"" is as easy as taking them off and letting them air out for a time or if you want them quicker you can use some water. When they reach dirty state now they are even more pungent, and also if you are wearing dirty cloths over an open wound you are more likely to get an infection. At this point they are dirty enough you'll need water to push them to the worn state or soup and water to push them to the clean state. Finally if you let them get so far as to get foul not only are infections more likely but it comes with a hit to your happiness. Advantage of foul clothing though is that now the zombies have a harder time telling your smell from their smell, so stealth is boosted. To get from foul to dirty will take both soup and water. In my mind foul clothes doesn't just happen from running around or wearing the same clothes for weeks on end. That just gets your clothes dirty. Foul happens when you are wearing dirty clothes and you keep fighting a horde of zombies and are getting splattered with their blood and guts. Finally ragged clothes are simply clothes that have become torn and are no longer as effective in keeping you warm. Still better than naked but not by much. Your better off just ripping these clothes into rags for bandages, though you could repair them with needle and thread.

As for thee traits I would like to see:

* Misaligned back: Must sleep on actual mattress or will have a poor night's sleep and wake up with an unhappy and pained moodlet. So no sleeping on the sofa or some random chair. Minor disadvantage (plenty of beds and honestly I didn't even know until recently that you COULD sleep on anything but a proper mattress)
* Absolute Timing: Who needs a watch, you always know exactly what time it is down to the minute. Minor advantage (a digital watch only weighs .1 and still has the advantage of having the alarm)
* Enjoys books: Takes longer for boredom to set in while reading training books. Minor advantage
* Dislikes reading: Boredom happens quicker while reading training books and it makes you sad. Minor disadvantage
* Alcoholism: All that alcohol you could use to disinfect wounds? Nope your character wants to drink it or so sad.
* No Skill Gain: Your skills are whatever they are upon character creation, but will never go up. Serious disadvantage
* Cultist: You believe something crazy about the zombies, and so get sad when you have to kill them. Serious disadvantage as the game is constantly putting us in positions where we feel we need to kill the zombies.
* Depressed: The end of the world has really got you down. Random sadness moodlets. Disadvantage
* One arm: You can put a bag on your back, and equip a primary item, but you can't equip a secondary item at all. Serious disadvantage as some things like dissembling doors takes a hammer and a screwdriver and you will just be unable to do these things.
* Foodie: Eating any cooked food makes you a bit happier regardless of what it is (Enough so that even a TV dinner doesn't make you unhappy). Advantage
* No Since of Taste: Food is food, you only get fullness from food not happiness or boredom hits. Disadvantage
* Delusional: Sound triggers will some times happen even when nothing caused it. Things like the you just noticed a zombie sound or even hearing them beat at windows and doors. Disadvantage
* Overconfident: You totally think you can clear out that building of zombies no problem. Zero point trait. This is many of us already.",Features I would like to see

When I get back to my base I'll then find out I already have 2 other copies of that exact same book. I'll think about making a list of what books and other things I need only one of somewhere but then of course I'll die, so lists just won't last long.

But then through just one random stupid thing I figured out a trick to keep track of what books I already have using only game mechanics.

I was trying to unload some books into my bookshelf and found out my shelf was entirely full and couldn't take any more books. But I knew I had some duplicate copies of books so I decided I would grab all the duplicates and toss them and free up space on the shelf.

So while looking at the bookshelf's inventory, I clicked that little expand button next to the icons for all my books so I could get a full list of books on the shelf. I then grabbed all the extra books and dashed off to a trashcan outside. While the books were in my inventory the lists were not expanded so I didn't think or worry about it to much, but when I got to the trash can and tossed them in I saw that the list expanded again automatically because I left them expanded on my bookshelf.

Got curious so just left them expanded and then went on a mission to specifically find a bookshelf I had never touched before. When I found it I saw that the books I already had were in expanded format while the books I did not have were still in their compressed format!

That's right, all it takes to keep track of what books (or anything else) that you have already looted is to expand the itemized list from the container you are looting from and it'll be expanded in ALL containers you might loot from.

EDIT: Adding a screenshot so it's clear what I'm talking about:
[Screenshot](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/177162708557040612/A820FAC3164363467896FC42095CA8A270A5EB87/)

So notice in this shot that from my inventory that First Aid for Beginners isn't expanded while all the books on the shelf are expanded. That is how you want it. If I pick up any book from the shelf and put it in my inventory or any of my sacks it'll be like First Aid for Beginners is and not expanded. But if I put it back then it'll be expanded. Likewise if I find any of these books on some random shelf I'll see them as expanded so know not to take them.

EDIT 2: So I noticed that while this works, there is one little problem. When you quit out of the game and come back later all your expanded item lists are compressed again. If you saved in your base, this is no huge problem as you can just run back over to your book storage and expand all your books again. But if you are out in the middle of no place then ya you are now back to trying to guess if you have books or not again.",Stupid Book Trick

So you got your tower and you think you are doing well. You've been filtering out under performing people, and making sure people are in their dream jobs and have a 9 in their primary stat. You've one way or another got a nice long list of people on your friends list, and you visit them every day, and most of them visit you in return every day. You are swimming in bucks and bits and you think: I'm going to spend some of my bucks on training some of my dudes so they pull in more bits per day with rent!

Well hold up there friend... You know it costs you 199 bucks just to get a lousy +1 to each of your character's stats that aren't already level 9 right? What if I told you that you could level up your dudes to max on all stats for only the cost of 5 bucks?

Here's how it works. Get yourself a good friend that has rebuilt his tower at least once and has also agreed to help you in this way (because it'll cost him 5 bucks a person also AND now one of his floors is reserved to helping you out). What your friend does is he spends his golden ticket on one of his residential units. Now any time someone moves to this floor he sends them directly to you.

So on your end anytime someone moves into your tower you send your friend one of your under performing dudes. If you don't have any under performing dudes (because the guy that just moved into your tower already has all 9's) you send your friend back a dude with all 9's.

Eventually you'll rebuild your tower, and you'll get a golden ticket yourself. Go ahead and put that on a residential unit. Now you and your friend can get a TRUE system going with both you and your friend doing this:

1. Random guy moves into non-gold floor. Send to friend for training.
1. Random guy moves into gold floor. Leave there but don't put in job.
1. Random guy comes from friend. Put in gold floor and send back guy from gold floor. Be really nice and look at your friends tower to see if any of the guys on your gold floor have dream jobs in your friends tower and if so have THAT guy be the guy you send back.
1. All 9's come from friend. Put in any floor with room (including your gold floor... but remember this one gold floor doesn't get to have employed people because they are only staying here until your friend sends you someone that needs training). Send nothing back.

General rule is that: 1 guy comes in 1 guy goes out. Do NOT try to be ""helpful"" by just sending your friend all 5 dudes from your gold floor as if his tower is full you'll just clog up his lobby. If your tower is full that's fine because you can still help your friend with training. When he sends you a dude you send him one from your gold floor and you now have room to house the guy he just sent you.",Multiplayer Tips

So before we get to the how to, let me give a little info. I'm still in T1 and here has been my progression in this game so far. I was playing else Heart.Break() and I was all, ""Okay, I'm done with this game now, let's look on YouTube for some other Hacking game."" And in short order I found Hackmud. Went right through the tutorial section and that was all fun, but then I got to T1.

I was utterly lost at what to do at this point. I knew I needed those abandoned things to get money but the tutorial didn't really go into much detail in find them in the first place. So a quick online search later and I quickly found out what tools I needed in my arsenal.

1. I needed a gathering script to weed out player scripts from npc scripts.
2. I needed a farming script to sort through the npc scripts to get me those locs.
3. I needed a password cracker to finally get me that GC.

Starting out I figured out was making the trusted scripts and went with those while I continued to do research. I knew I needed to get off of using other people's scripts for a few reasons. The and biggest is being that those player scripts that I trust could go away at any moment. Someone might go evil or stop playing the game or get hacked or blah blah blah...

But the REAL problem was that all the free farming scripts I was finding kept returning back either only one entry or a list that contained corrupted entries.

And that brings us to the meat of the matter. I wrote up my own farming script and got it to give me a nice list of stuff that might have money in it for me to take. But mine like the other free ones was coming back with corruption. Here is all it takes to get rid of corruption:

    function (context, args) { //target:""string""
    	var word = args.target,
    		corruption = /[¡|¢|£|¤|¥|¦|§|¨|©|ª]/i
    	
    	if (corruption.test(word)) {
    		return true
    	}
    	
    	return false
    }

Now obviously you aren't likely to want to fill up one of your script slots with such a small script. This is just a proof of concept. You can upload this script to yourself, and feed it some strings you know have corruption and strings you know don't have corruption. Once you are confident that this script does what I say I does, it's time to put it into your own script where it belongs. The important bits are:

    var corruption = /[¡|¢|£|¤|¥|¦|§|¨|©|ª]/i

and later:

    if (corruption.test(word)) {
    // What you want your script to do if it found corruption goes here...
    }

You can go ahead and replace word with your own string variable, and you can shorten the word corruption down to a single character if you are trying your hardest to shorten your code to fit in your current size limits. But there you have it. Simple little insert to put in your scripts. All for only about 50 characters.",Corruption test

There are three things we can do in the base game that shed a serious bit of light on the Institute's FEV program. They are to talk with Virgil, explore the Institute, and read Swan's notes. To understand things a bit better let's make a timeline of events involving the institute and the FEV. I'll be using information provided off of the Wiki so not all of the stuff on this timeline can be found in FO4.

* 2052 - The New Plague strikes the world killing tens of thousands
* 2055 - West Tek starts working on a virus to kill the New Plague
* 2075 - West Tek names their work the FEV and starts tests on multi-celled orginizisms
* 2077a - The New Plague is still largely uncontrolled
* 2077b - FEV Research moved to Military Base
* 2077c - Research of FEV is leaked to the public
* 2077d - World gets pissed about FEV and uses this as one of many excuses to...
* 2077e - Start Great War
* 2077d - FEV Research lab is a target of one of the nukes, releasing many FEV strains into the remaining world.
* 2078 - Vault 87 continues research on FEV by turning everyone into Super Mutants.
* 2102 - The Master is created through exposure to FEV
* 2162? - The Master is defeated
* 2174? - The Master is for sure defeated by this point (Depending on player speed at FO1. Timeline assumes player wins)

So that's the history of the FEV before it got to the Institute...

* 2178 - FEV Research by the Institute Begins
* 2180 - Super Mutant attack on Diamond City
* **2187 - Nick and Dimi** escape
* 2204 - Curie finishes the Universal Cure (Well it's about time someone found a cure for the New Plague that's been affecting so much of history for the past 152 years. Shame it's wasted on a nobody boy or the lone wanderer.)
* 2224 - FEV Research starts to deadlock. Needs untainted Subjects to test the 2 most promising strains for Synthetic Organics project
* 2227 - Shaun is kidnapped
* 2229 - Broken Mask happens in Diamond City only 2 years after tests started with Shaun.
* **2242 - Harkness and Armitage are built**, and between now and...
* 2277a - Harkness escapes to the common wealth and his fate is decided in FO3
* 2277b - Not long after Madison Li is recruited by the Institute
* 2277c - Around this time we know was the last time any useful information came out of the FEV program according to Virgil
* 2282 - Mayor McDonough passes anti-ghoul degree. It's believed at this point he was already replaced as a Synth, but exactly when is uncertain
* 2287a - Virgil has escaped the institute and is now in hiding
* 2287b - Shaun dies (either by the player's hand or due to some sickness)

Okay so that's a lot to take in and some of it isn't that important for this theory but it's there mostly so you can track when things are going on. We also don't know dates for some things such as when they started putting implants into Kellogg. We know it was from before Shaun became Father, but we don't know if they started giving him implants before or after he kidnapped Shaun. We do know though that for various reasons the implant program was discontinued. Unfortunately I can't find the specific quote that you are given by Shaun but I seem to recall that they found the implants to be unstable. This suggests that they are based on pre-Shaun tech.

We know directly from the game that the Institute is kidnapping people then enhancing them with FEV, and then using the data they collect from these Super Mutants to create Synthetic Organics. We know that 9 years after they started their FEV research project that the two most advanced Synths they have been able to create are Nick and Dimi. This would be your Gen 2 line. All the Synthis before 2178 would be your Gen 1 Synths. But by 2224 the FEV research is producing no new information that can be used to create better Synths. So it's proposed to kidnap Shaun for his prewar DNA. Now while it is never explicitly stated in the game it's very clear that they exposed young baby Shaun to one or both of those promising strains of the FEV virus. Within 2 years of doing this they had created a Gen 3 Synth that was good enough that someone decided to field test it in Diamond City. That test ""failed"" but it also demonstrated that even in 2 years they were able stride dramatically forward.

But 50 so years later we know that Virgil says that the FEV program isn't producing any new data that's helpful. Yet the director (likely Shaun at this Point) doesn't want it to stop. The question is why?

The answer is simple, Shaun already knows he is sick despite (or because of) being exposed to a strain of the FEV. His strain likely enhanced his intelligence and perhaps even his physical capabilities but without being the unstable sort that caused him to turn into a green skin. We also know that Father has been keeping his sickness a secret, so of course Virgil doesn't know he's actually doing the FEV research in an effort to cure Shaun. What though is it that could be causing an illness in Father? Is it some unknown sickness that we've seriously never heard of before? Or is it actually possible that he is now a survivor of the New Plague.

It's likely even that Shaun's parents are survivors of the New Plague, hence them being so protective of Shaun (beyond just that they are his parents). From the Wiki we know that survivors of the New Plague usually ended up sterile. So imagine how much joy they would have at finding out they were able to have children if they had just recently survived the Plague. What's more let's talk Codsworth for a moment. He's obviously a recent purchase by the family, but I don't care how good your military pay was, you are NOT going to have enough money to pay for such a fancy robot UNLESS you got discharged from the military for MEDICAL reasons and you have Military Disability helping pay for your bills. Neither Nate nor Nora though seem outwardly unhealthy. But so what. Just because you can't SEE something wrong with someone doesn't mean they don't have a disability.

But okay so Shaun may have had the New Plague, but why does this matter? Because he WAS sterile. He wanted a legacy and with everyone calling him father he wanted to create a child. It's even possible that Shaun was trying to obtain immortality through Synth-Shaun. Li mentions in one of her tapes that they are still a ways from mapping Shaun's memories into Synth-Shaun. It seems though that this was a long term plan though because if it wasn't, why bring it up in a log that it isn't that way.

I would not be surprised if it turned out on the day that he learned of Virgil's betrayal if that wasn't also the exact same day that he revived your character from the Vault. Or shortly after.

So full theory:

1. Shaun is experimented on after being kidnapped with FEV
2. Either FEV or New Plague has made him long term sick and among his problems he can't have children.
3. The institute Directors all secretly want immortality (Well not so secretly).
4. In Shaun's case he decides there are 2 good paths for achieving this Mapping his mind into the most state of the art Synth based on him and/or fixing the problems with the FEV strain he has.
5. Time is almost up for Shaun and Virgil betrays him. Now instead of working on a relaxed time schedule Shaun needs to focus his efforts on Synth-Shaun so contacts Kellogg to get the child back and also have Kellogg go punish Virgil.
6. With it still being some time before Shaun will be able to map his mind onto his dream Synth before his death he is feeling the weight of his mortality. It is ONLY now that he has your character revived.

This leaves only one Question left for me that I don't have the answer too... What is the importance Shaun has placed in the age 10? He created a 10 year old version of himself. Not even a teenager, not younger... so why 10? Sure in 2237 (when Shaun would have been 10) the Enclave was doing some stuff with the FEV themselves, but that was on the other side of the country. So what pivotal moment happened in Shaun's life for him to say the best time of my life was when I was 10 years old and I wish to live as that age forever.",[Theory]Why did the Institute keep studying the FEV virus?

But this got me thinking, is transmuting all your iron ore into gold rings the BEST thing you can do when it comes to making money with your iron ore. The first thing to consider is that 2 iron ore can be turned into 2 rings with a combined base value of 150g. Furthermore we can enchant both rings further increasing there value before we sell them to some merchant.

My math though will not consider the specifics of the specific value of those enchantments though. Instead we'll just say if we enchant an item we can reliably increase its value by X. This means our rings are actually worth 150+2x.

So my first thought was, well let's say we decide transmuting iron up to some degree (either to silver or gold) is the route to go. We need to then decide if we want to combine that silver/gold with gems to make valuable jewelry. Looking at the silver jewelry first, it's quick to see that the base value of jeweled silver jewelry is always less than the base value of 2 gold rings + whatever gem would have been used.

A brief side track has me consider though if we already have a silver bar should we turn that into 2 silver rings or combine that with a gem to make some special jewelry. And it turns out that the base value of silver jewelry is always 60+the base value of the gem, and because gem crafting always gets you only one piece of jewelry we may as well turn all random silver bars we find into pairs of silver rings with a combined value of 60. This way we get double the enchantments.

So now that we have fully eliminated using iron ore to make silver the question is, if we make iron ore into gold do we always want to make that gold into gold rings or do we want to combine that with gems? For this the math shows that only flawless diamond amulets are worth more, but that's before taking enchantments into account.

We need to decide if 1150+2x is greater or less than 1200+x... and for that we need x to be at least 25g. And here's the kicker... Flawless Diamonds don't even start showing up in random loot until level 40, so if you've been doing enchanting you should be able to generate a value of at least 25g on your enchantments. But again, I'm not going to worry to much about the specifics of enchantment value math. But it's looking like gold rings should still be the way to go even still.

All that leaves us is deciding if we should transmutation in the first place. If we go with transmutation we result in a value of 150g + the time it takes to do all that transmutation.

With iron (and even steel) there is nothing that comes even close to having that value as most of the stuff takes multiple iron bars. BUT before you rush off and start changing all your iron ore into gold rings do remember... most merchants will not actually buy gold rings and will quickly run out of money (until you get the perks that give them more money and let you sell anything to any merchant).

The good news is that iron ore weights the same as gold ore, so you may as well start converting it as you find it or while you run around between locations. Second of all once you get that gold to the smelter gold rings weigh only a quarter the weight of the raw ore, so you'll even be reducing your carry weight down even if you can't sell it all right now. Heck, you'll even soon have so much money that you'll be able to get a home in each of the holds to store all the gold rings you'll be swimming in.",To transmute or not to transmute

Well first of all, all designs should leave room for both Solar Powered and Efficient, as all set ups benefit from them. Taking this into account, a top level Plumbot really only has 5 empty slots for us to work with.

1. Housekeeper - You are to busy creating more Plumbots, so of course you want a Plumbot with Competent Cleaner, HandiBot, and Steel Chef. You can make this as early as level 3. This leaves you two more slots to fill with what makes sense for your house hold. Perhaps the Nanny Chip if you also have children... why do you have children? Okay ya so everyone knows about this one, what else we got?
2. SimBot Band - One of these guys will work just fine for pulling in tips passively while you work, but you could also create another to so that they can be in a Band together. Obviously it gets Musical Machine, but actually you don't want to give it to many more chips beyond that. The goal here is for it to always be pulling you in money passively. Don't want it to get distracted by talking to someone about their feelings.
3. Science Bot 5000 - So this one is actually a little interesting. The science career is dependent on three skills and all three of those skills have chips for them. HandiBot, A.I. Angler, and RoBotany Gardener will make sure your Plumbot always has the skills it needs, and Office Drone will let us send our bot to work. That leaves us with one more slot, that may as well just be left empty so as not to distract your robot from SCIENCE! Though this one is a bit more tricky than the others, as just to make the 4 required chips you'll need to be level 7 in your bot making. You might think of putting in just a couple chips to start so it can start working while you do the rest, but annoyingly that doesn't lower the starting level requirement at all as the first skill for performance gain is Gardening and that is the level 7 chip.
4. Maintenance Bot - Again a tricky bot as this one is less create and ignore, and it's centered on only one chip. Limitless Learning. Obviously you'll want this bot once having that level 8 chip to learn Bot Building so that it can do good Tune Ups on your other bots, but you'll also want it learning the Science skill. Why the science skill? So you can get the Science Machine Group Project from University and have your bot working with the Green point on that pretty much non-stop...

Of course once you have Maintenance Bot, with a high level of Bot Building and it regularly keeping the Hive Mind up and running... we've just achieved Sky Net... Good bye Human Race.

As a note on the SimBot Band Robot, if you are playing in Sunset Valley and have seasons turned on, you might have trouble earning tips as for some reason people sometimes don't tip unless you are at a Big Park, and the default Big Park is almost always a Festival Park and not a Big Park...

The solution to this is of course to not send your SimBot to that park but instead send them to Performance Park (Venue that's added with the Showtime Expansion) as that is a Big Park. Further more it isn't even that expensive of a park, so you could fairly easily purchase it and add in a bathroom for your human visitors, and a robot charging station so that your bots can recharge without needing to come home. You'll just have to go visit them or have them come home every now and then for tune ups.

So I would be glad to hear what other chip set ups people have in mind. Keep in mind that unless there is a specific reason you wouldn't want to include Solar Powered and Efficient then you only have 5 chip slots to work with though you need not fill them all.",Best use of Plumbots
3331,d73zv,20183,False,False,True,True,GeekyMeerkat,1456,GeekyMeerkat,4sfnn3,2016-07-12 09:39:43,2.0,0.0,"All right everyone, it's time for a serious sit down discussion about Sims 3 and Sims 4. First let's get the big ones out of the way so we don't need to dwell on them... Yes Sims 3 is buggy and you need mods to make it work well. Yes Sims 4 needs more content that we miss from Sims 3.

No what I would like to talk about are some of the things that Sims 3 did right and some of the things that Sims 4 could improve upon once they get around to making a similar feature. And no, I don't want to talk about Life States, as I did that recently.

First on my mind is seasons from Sims 3. Absolutely loved that in fall and winter we actually had things like leaves on the ground we needed to rake, and snow that was deep enough to actually hide collectibles from view. The seasons themselves were great and I even liked how you could go into the options and lock your game into specific seasons. All that stuff can come right on over to Sims 4. But...

Then there were the seasonal holidays (not the seasonal festivals, but the holiday). The Holidays are so annoying because on the default time scale they happen once a week and force you to take a day off from work. This slows down getting promoted so much. But I don't want to see the Holidays just removed. No what I would like to see is that the Holidays are still there, but that when one of them rolls around you have the option to call into work to take Holiday, and that doesn't count against your vacation days. Much the way taking maternity leave works in the game currently.

For the Seasonal Holidays you would get an option to host a party that could only be hosted on that Holiday. Though Fall instead of having a Spooky Day Party would get a Feast Party (as we already have a Spooky Themed Party with that free Halloween update).

Other than seasons, I would love to see a greater variety in the worlds we have for the Sims 4. Early on the worlds in Sims 3 were all much the same... Sunset Valley didn't really feel that different visually from Twinbrook or Riverview. But as they got in the rhythm of things, each world they released had it's own very distinct look and feel. It would be very hard for instance to confuse Lunar Lakes with Monte Vista. Though let's be fair, to make a well designed world that has its own look and feel does take time and effort so it might be that the reason we haven't seen to many new worlds in Sims 4 yet because they want to do it right. I would absolutely say that they did a good job with the appearance of Windenburg. New Crest though feels a bit to much like Willow Creek for me, but it was a free empty world intended to just give us more room to build so I can't fault them to much on that.

But what I would love to see them bring forward is a cost of some sort to visiting distant locals. Sure you can go anywhere in your own world at no cost, but you want to visit this other world that has been built with heavy roman architecture themes? Well then you'll need to take a vacation like you would if you want to visit Granite Falls. Or you could just move there, but then if you wanted to come back here for some reason you would need to take a vacation in this direction.

On that note, I would love to see them bring back player vehicles. Both cars and bikes, though I would also like to see motorcycles and skates (of the roller or board verity). Small vehicles like bikes and skates would be used in place of walking or running, and would be a boon when you want to gather collectibles in one of the big neighborhoods. You would also be able to do tricks with them (And as such should have a skill linked with them like how there is a skill linked with Dancing now).

Bigger vehicles like cars or trucks would reduce the cost of traveling to distant worlds. Want to go on a vacation to Granite Falls? Well if you own a station wagon it's much easier to pack all your camping gear and heck that station wagon could even work as a uncomfortable tent if something messed up the tent you packed. They would also just be a nice way of showing off your wealth. A fancy house really does need a number of fancy cars parked out front. Furthermore your handy sims should be able to tinker with any of their vehicles (and not just a single special DLC vehicle).

Basically that DLC vehicle should be used as a guideline for cars in the Sims 4. We should be able to sit and chill with our date in the car. Rev the engine (with a car a handy sim having tweeked sounding more impressive), listen to the radio... and GASP... Woohoo (with some cars being better for that and other cars giving you an uncomfortable moodlet like how you can sometimes get poked wrong when woohooing in the closet).

While we are on the topic of vehicles, let's talk boats briefly. Okay Maxis you know you messed up with that in 3. The idea of the Island Paradise expansion was amazing, but the pathing with the boats was so wonky as to practically make that entire world unplayable. But just because you did it wrong before, this doesn't mean you can't try again. It'll just take a bit of effort. I believe you'll find there is a demand for that DLC being done correctly for the Sims 4.

But before we can trust our Sims in boats, we need smarter Sims in general. And this means another visit to the University. We even already have most the mechanics in the game already. Or at least the big ones. In Sims 3, the features I enjoyed most about it were getting in good with those three groups and the science stuff. Those three groups are already being handled much better with the Club system now in the game, and actually most the science stuff is handled by the Science Career from Get to Work. So you might not think that there is much need for University with both of those in place...

There is though a key dynamic you entirely forgot (or decided not to) make a big deal in Sims 3. Sure with those three groups your Sim had interesting stories they could tell. Were they a Jock that couldn't stand Nerds and Rebels, or were they someone that got on with all the groups? But what about the Facility. I've been playing Sims 3 again lately, and while I know in the list of people my Sim meant her professors were in there somewhere, they just didn't stand out at all. Heck I honestly couldn't tell you at any time if my Sim was interacting with someone that was another Student or a Professor or even just a random townie the game created to help populate the world.

That was also the expansion that brought us Roommates if memory serves, but even if it's not that's what I would like to talk about now. I love Roommates in Sims 3. I in general only ever control one Sim, and would love if the other Sims just all did their own thing properly. Having the other Sims living in the household as room mates removed any worry about their actions. If they went and got themselves killed in a fire that would be their own fault and not mine because I was neglecting them.

But that too could be improved. I would love the ability to properly designate rooms as bed rooms and bath rooms and what not, so that not only would the Gallery know how to sort it, but also the Sims would be able to claim them. Not just a bed, but entire rooms. Is this a shared bathroom or a private bath? If I have a room mate they should be able to claim a bed room and claimable bathroom. Once they have done that they should be able to actually put things down inside the room like paintings and computers and what not. Those things would belong to them and we wouldn't be able to do anything with them even in build mode. Evict the roommate and they would take their things with them.

But how would we do that right? If you give a sim free rain to put things down wherever they want they might do something stupid like block themselves in a room. The way I see it though is we would put down ""ghost"" objects, like a ghost bed. The Roommate would them put down a bed that they can afford and want there. When they stop being a roommate those things would all go back to being ghost objects. Heck we already even already have a type of ghost object what with the Retail lots and the sold out signs. But in this case we would be planning out a room using pretty much just a variant of those sold out signs and then the sim roommate would do the rest to fill it in.

As a nearly final note, I want to talk about Toddlers. I know a HUGE vocal part of the community want the Toddlers to come back. But honestly I don't mind them being gone to much. The whole point with the Toddler life stage was that if you raised your sim well you would get to pick their traits. But in the Sims 4 we get to pick their traits already. So unless you nerfed that then that primary purpose of being a Toddler really goes out the window. What I would ask though is if there are people that really want to see Toddlers come back is how would you balance them to work with Sims 4 as it is now? Why would I keep my kid in that life stage any longer than getting a cake out and aging the sim right up to child? A quick idea that comes to mind is perhaps I get an extra trait if I have a good Toddler period (not just a reward trait but an actual 4th CAS trait).

Heck now that I think about it, I honestly think that should also be the reward for sending your Sim to University in Sims 4. An extra CAS trait just like in Sims 3. Then if you did that reward also for Toddler, a ""well raised"" sim would have 5 CAS traits.

Now for my truly final note for right now... bring back Favorites. Favorite Food, Favorite Drink, Favorite Music, Favorite Color, Favorite whatever... Have a boost when doing stuff involving favorites and a penalty if doing something that's conflicting with the favorite. IE: Extra happy listening to Favorite Music, fine if listening to most other musics, but unhappy if listening to the ""wrong"" music station.",Let's Talk Sims 3 and Sims 4

Under Long hair there are a ton of hair styles that don't even come to the shoulders even with a tied up bun in back. Under Medium hair you have a number of hair styles that look just as short as the Short hair styles... and then under short you styles with a big bun in back implying that they are actually longer than they appear.

Can we please get some consistency on what is considered what length. I don't have screen shots handy but, there are some that really stand out to me...

If you are creating a female character and select long hair styles and limit the pack down to the Get Together styles, the 5th option you have to pick is extremely short. From Get to Work, the first long hair style is more of a medium style. From Cool Kitchen the 3rd long hair style is more of a short style. From Movie Hangout the 5th long style is more of a medium. 

If you now switch to medium hair styles, these are the hair styles that stand out. The 1st style is more of a short style for Get to Work. For Get Together the 4th and 5th are both more of a short style. From Romantic Garden, the only medium option should actually be short.

Finally for the short hair styles, these are the hair styles that stand out. From Luxury Party the only short hair option should be a medium or even long hair option with the size of that bun. This is based on the fact that it has MORE hair than the Luxury Party Medium option.

Now mind you these are all just the most obvious ones that I found. There were a few that I considered border line enough between Medium and Short that they could stay just where they are. But even among Medium and short there are a number like the two from Luxury Party where they obviously have more or less hair than some counter part in the other hair length area.

And this isn't even considering men's hair lengths. This also isn't even considering the huge number of Base Game styles that should be shifted up or down a category or two (Mainly because it's harder to make sure we are talking about the same hair style without screen shots at that point).

Here is a general guideline to go by to know if a hair style is short, medium, or long... If it makes it to the shoulders then it's long. This includes Pony Tails that are that long. If it's not to the shoulders but past the ears then it's medium. Medium in general should hold all the bun styles that look like they have a good amount of hair in it for the most part. As for short, that's pretty much all that stuff that isn't long or medium.

Okay so I decided to take 2 screen shots. One of a long hair style one of a short hair style, as the game classifies them.

But an idea came to mind, and I'm hoping someone that understands wiring knows how to pull this off...

I would like a fueling station for my trains that if I have wood it will put only that in the fueling box, removing any other fuel types first. If I don't have any wood, then it would insert solid fuel first removing any thing in the box. Finally if I didn't have any wood or solid fuel it should then and only then tap into my coal.

I'm aware we can't link the train to logistic networks directly (without mods), so the logic stuff would only be able to look at the box that fuels the train, so I can think of a few situations that might happen...

1. The train is entirely full of fuel, but there are higher priority fuels (like wood) in the network. This is fine because the box gets filled with wood and as soon as a slot opens up on the train it dumps in the wood.
2. While running the train uses up a stack of fuel and starts working on the the second stack. It hits a fueling station and now has two types of fuel. The middle stack though is partially empty because it's the wrong fuel type. This is okay though because then the 3rd stack should fill up all the way with the current fuel type.
3. The stack isn't able to be filled up all the way because the system runs out of wood. Now the train has a partial middle stack and a partial third stack. But this too shouldn't be a problem because now the fuel type is switched to the next tier, and the middle stack is filled up.
4. The middle stack doesn't get filled up because that fuel type too is low. That's okay though because now it should still have a full 1st stack that hasn't even been touched.
5. While running the train burns through the two partial stacks, and finally starts burning the 1st stack. It then gets back to the train station, and gets refueled. If that 1st stack is of the current fuel type it'll get restocked. If it's not of the right type then the train does have two empty slots so it will still get some sort of fuel.
6. Worst case situation, you are running low on all types of fuel and so all three slots are of different fuel types and are only partial stacks. In this case you've got bigger problems then worrying about if your train has run out of fuel in the middle of the line.",Train Fuel Loader?

But here are my own thoughts for what I would like to see added to the Contraptions for it to feel ""Correct""...

1. I would like a Settler Item Storage that you could put at the end of a belt like you can with the Storage unit you can already build. This Settler Item Storage would every now and then ping a settler and check their equipment. If an item in the box was considered 'better' the Settler would come and swap it out. You could then for instance set up a factory to create combat armor and your settlers would gradually equip themselves without you needing to manually track them all down.
2. A counter link. This one is a bit tricky, but here's how I see it... you have a factory and it's set to something say Combat Chest Armor. That is then connected with a power line to the Counter Link, and the counter link is set to some number (say 5). The counter link is then connected to a a storage chest. If the chest has less than that many of that type of item in it then the factory is on. If it's got more though it turns the factory off so you don't keep producing more.
3. Mod Maker. A factory unit that lets you manufacture mods for your equipment. So you have a factory making Combat armor, and this factory making shadow mods for your combat armor... this goes with...
4. Mod Connector. Connects mods to items that will take that mod. You've got your combat armor coming down the line and the shadow mods coming down another line... time to connect them together and have shadowed combat armor.
5. T intersections. Okay so right now if you have two lines you want to combine, the easiest way to do that is to connect both lines to the same hopper. The hopper will then drop both items down to the same line. Disadvantage though is that to do this we have to have gone upward first. Why isn't there a T intersection though so things can be dealt with on the same level.
6. Fast Conveyors. I'm not saying replace the current conveyors with fast ones. I'm saying we should have these and then additional fast ones. Perhaps the fast ones can't turn and so can only go in a straight...  but it would still be nice to have a fast option.
7. More crafting options in general. If it's a non-unique item that I can hold in the game then I should be able to make it with some machine or another. Obviously I don't need to be able to manufacturer Silver Shroud Armor... But there is no reason I shouldn't be able to manufacture Road Leathers, leather jackets, or army helmets if I so choose.

That's all that comes to mind off the top of my head. I think there were other things I was thinking while I was toying around with the new DLC, but those are the things that stuck out to me.",Contraptions Mod Idea

For those that don't know the term, this is when your Sim has some special property like being an Alien or a Ghost. A refresher if you can't recall what Life States the Sims 4 has (and this is even counting minor or temporary life states):

1. Alien: You can create them in CAS, or your sim might encounter them. Easiest way to find them in the world is to go to Alien night at the bar as it requires no skills or job. Aliens have some interesting mental powers and can greatly change how you play the game depending on how secretive you want your Alien sim to be about their heritage.
2. Ghost: Kill a sim off and you might encounter their ghost. Make friends with the ghost and you can add it to your household. Don't age, and have some little ghostly tricks, but they can't have children. Though you can bring them back to life using various methods.
3. Plant Sim: A temporary state that's more just for show, achieved by eating a specific ice cream.
4. Evil Clone: Not exactly a life state as it's basically just a copy of some other sim with one of the traits replaced to being evil. Technically you could create this in CAS by saving a sim then important it right back into the household and replacing one of the traits manually.
5. Transgender: Creatable in CAS, and seemingly only if you do something. I've yet to encounter a Transgender Sim randomly in the world.

And that's it for right now to my knowledge. Though to be fair all of those Life States are entirely mixable. You can have a Transgender Alien sim who has become a ghost and then gotten him/her self an evil clone that is under the effect of that specific ice cream. So props for that.

But I would love to see more. What brings on this whole post is the new monster under the bed update. In the Sims 3 we had the Imaginary Friend Life state. While I wouldn't want the monster under the bed to be the same as the imaginary friend, it would be cool if by befriending the monster we could add a Monster Sim to our household.

The thing that I like about life states is it gives you a chance to tell some interesting stories. How do these two sims of vastly different life states express their feelings toward each other? What are the goals of this sim and how are they affected by their life state? For instance, while achievements aren't a huge deal in the Sims 4, did you know there is an achievement for an alien getting married to a normal sim before the normal sim learns the truth? This is actually rather hard to pull off as any time your Alien sim enters a Very emotional state they start to glow, and the secret is ruined. For me at least my sims are almost always in a Very emotional state because it's just so easy to get there on accident.

But imagine if they brought back the Vampire life state. They could do something interesting with that for if a Vampire tries to drink the blood of an alien. Perhaps they get a dazed moodlet for a few hours because of the strange taste of the blood. Or perhaps it's addictive and a Vampire that drinks alien blood gets a bored moodlet when drinking human blood until they find a way to break the addiction. And what if we had a Vampire Alien... ghost. Yes I totally feel like those life states should all be able to be mixed and matched.

Or imagine if they bring back some sort of Robot life state. I really liked building my own custom robots in the Time Travel expansion of 3, and trying to make a Robot family. I think it would be interesting if they went a 'Bicentennial man' way with a  Robot life state in that a Robot could become less and less robotic with various modifications. Or a non-robot could become more and more Robotic by having various surgeries.

I'm by no means asking for these life states for free. Though was glad with the ghost life state being provided for free. I just hope that they bring us some interesting life states that interact with other life states in fun and enjoyable ways.",Sims 4 Life States

Normally they only make men pregnant. But I notice I can also now create a character where I click the male button but then set all the gender things to female including the ability to get pregnant.

Would such a character be seen as male by the aliens and perhaps get pregnant? Or do Aliens make people pregnant based on someone's ability to get other's pregnant? (So a female that can make people pregnant would now be potential alien host.)

Nothing super serious, just things like the TV announcer at the start of the game saying he's received confirmed reports that New York and other places have been struck. In such cases when it's talking about confirmed places that have been struck it also mentions Pennsylvania and Washington DC.

We had Fallout 3 in Washington DC, and one of it's DLC in Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh specifically). So now I'm curious, do people think that New York will be visited as it's own game (IE FO5 or later), will it be a DLC of Fallout 4?

If it's a DLC for FO4, personally I hope that they stay away from visiting New York City or Manhattan as I would rather those places be visited in a full proper FO5. Though I don't know New York well enough to know likely locations where they might take the player.

Some people mention that the next big DLC might be something called Nuka World or something like that, and so it's got me wondering if there are any bottling companies in New York. A quick Google search for ""bottling companies in new york"" reveals interestingly that Coca-Cola Bottling Co is within New York. To my understanding Nuka-Cola has always been more a stand in for Coca-Cola and not Pepsi so that seemed interesting to me.

Another thought is that the Coney Island Amusement Park is in New York and that seems an apt place to replace with a Nuka World.

Also a last thought on the whole thing... I'm reminded that Batman and the Joker (who often uses abandoned amusement parks as his base of operations) do their stuff in Gotham, and that Gotham is based on New York. This line of thought also got me thinking about FO3's Pint-sized slasher, that clown faced killer we all love. However a quick check into the known lore about the Pint-sized slasher he seemed (if real) to have operated in German Town in the DC region. Though Bethesda is known for doing retcons or adapting old lore (like they did with the Mechanistic).

So I leave you with these thoughts, perhaps Nuka World takes place in New York in or around the Coney Island Amusement Park area and involves the Pint Sized Slasher in some way. Just thoughts (and perhaps a bit of hope).",New York?

Codsworth? Ya we don't care about him.

Later once the character encounters living people it's decided to just stick with it and claim it's a new religion.

To make matters even more ""fun"" the character is only using unarmed fighting (though I can used unarmed weapons like knuckles or power fists if I find them).

I will admit during the mission to free Garvey I did use the power armor, but not the mini-gun. I did encounter a strange glitch though with the death claw, in that the first few punches I did to him while solidly hitting they didn't do any damage. I know they hit because I had a full critical meter and a banked critical and used both right away. Neither did any damage.

Anyways after that battle, I dropped off the power armor and went back to running around naked punching things. I'm currently in diamond city and wondering if I've got the perks I want for freeing Nick from Skinny. The annoying thing about that fight though is all their automatic weapons.

But the one reason I'm wondering this is while on my way to diamond city I was punching some Super Mutants in the back of the head, and I realized I still haven't taken the Ninja perk yet.

See when I started the build I put my Strength to 9 and my Agility to 9 so I could have access to blitz and rooted right away (as without any sort of clothing they'll be my primary defense). I also put luck up to 6 and then used the baby book to bump that up to 7 so I would have early access to Critical Banker with the logic two really strong punches right in a row would really help with that death claw (I'm still salty that they both glitched and did no damage, but luckily Rooted and Med-X kept me alive.

I've also been putting points into the Iron Fist Perk because of course I need that, and one point in blacksmith so I could make sure I could upgrade my knuckles right away. In addition to that I've been putting perk points into sneak... so seriously I'm confused why I haven't taken Ninja yet.

Oh and I've got idiot savant of course because with nothing in intelligence that's really the only way to level. But here I was thinking I had all my perks I needed right now and have been putting spare points in Endurance, so that I can reach Rad Resistant (as I figure I'll need that to get through the glowing see if I don't want to just spam Rad-X)...

In any event though, even without Ninja I'm thinking that I should be good for taking out Skinny's guys. Once they see me that perk won't do any good anyways, and they don't even have armor. Really I just need to get a good quick punch to the face I think.

Though I might be in trouble if I have a hard time in there. When I did a Melee build on survival I was getting torn apart repeatedly until I went and got Pickman's blade. But a quick check of my options for unarmed and short of fighting swan it doesn't look like there are any sure bets for nice equipment I can use... that and I'll be naked unlike my knife using character.

EDIT ADD: I decided with a whole bunch of drugs to kill Swan. It wasn't going well at first as he would kill me fairly quick as would be expected. Then I developed a tactic of going in and punching him while on jet (and other drugs) and then sprinting out of there. I would then jog (not sprint) around trees and what not while he would throw rocks at me while missing. Once my AP was back up it was time for more jet. I do have to say that was one of the more satisfying times I've killed Swan, as normally I wait until I'm OP and then I just melt him for the sake of melting him.",No pants run!

Before we get to exactly what Piper says, let's touch briefly on what all the other companions talk about.

1. Currie wants to do tests
2. Danse congratulates you on infiltrating the institute
3. Codworth, Hancock, McCready, Valentine, Preston, and Strong are surprised you are still alive.
4. Deacon and Cait both bet on if you would make it back with various people (Cait bets against you).

Okay so generally people had serious concerns of if you would even survive. Some thought you might have been killed by the machine, while others thought the institute might have killed you. But now what does Piper say? She suggests that you might have been replaced by a Synth and then instantly discounts the idea because you still look like you and that's just ~crazy~ to think you might be a Synth...

But seriously? Why wouldn't this be a HUGE concern for everyone? And when I say everyone, I mean anyone that might have known you were going in and not just your companions. First of all we already know that the institute regularly replaces members of various people's family's with it taking some time before anyone ever even notices. Second of all your companions make it clear that they thought this was a one way trip for you.

I've posted before that I think the player is a Synth, but this is totally different here. This is the point when everyone that knows you should have some serious concerns on if you are a Synth or not. The way I see it is this should go down a few ways...

1. You were human, and are still human but because there is no way to identify a Synth without killing them so some NPCs should now distrust you.
2. You were human, and are now a synth. Some how people find out, and you realize that the institute has been telling you lies and manufactured the memories of your meeting with Father. (Unlikely as in that scene you have free will to choose as you want.)
3. You were a synth and have been a synth since you woke up in vault 111. But now people think you are a synth, and you are having a hard time convincing them that THIS wasn't the moment you were replaced.

Now let's say you get back and you decide to work with the Institute. Sure Brotherhood and Railroad both think you are working for them, but they should also be keeping a close eye on you for any changes in personality. But the Railroad never even suspects you've decided to turn your back on them until you are killing them all. At least with the Brotherhood there is that Institute quest you do that causes the Brotherhood to realize you've shifted your loyalties before you are on the final quest to kill all the Brotherhood.

But seriously nobody ever suspects (other than Piper for that brief moment) that you were replaced by a Synth? Exactly how does the Institute Ending play out differently from what you would expect of a Synth replacement?

A quick look at Fluffy's video with companion responses to you siding with the Institute, reveals that while some people hate you for what you've done not one of them wonders if it was really you that did this or if you were replaced by a Synth at some point.

We all know that I think the player is a Synth, but to me this avoidance of people accusing you of perhaps being a Synth falls in the same lines as what happened with Valentine's assistant (and everyone else that tells you about him) that you are looking for a Synth prototype. It's avoidance of an obvious issue for a dramatic reveal later. In this case later as in DLC. We already have Dima's question about if the player is a Synth, and it's likely all the DLC's will have an over arching theme of some sort.

So either Bethesda plan on doing more with the question on if the player is a synth and has been one all along with more DLC (and people not suspecting you are a synth here is all to ~enhance~ later drama), or Bethesda is done teasing us with that the player might be a Synth and it won't come up in any more DLC. In this case this whole situation here is just EVERYONE involved being foolish in not at least having some healthy questions on if you got replaced or not.",FO4: Almost nobody has a brain

October 22nd, 2287 - Today has been a horrid day. So was yesterday and that was some 200 years ago. Let me back up a moment. I'm John Hopgood, and I was selected do to my scientific knowledge for the Vault Tec program to help rebuild the world after a nuclear war.

We were told that in the event war broke out we would be notified to head to a Vault that would keep us safe from any fallout. After thirty days, we would then leave the vault and begin repairing the damage. I knew going into this that Vault Tech was fluffing things up. If a bomb struck anywhere near us to cause damage, the fallout wouldn't clear up in 30 days. But still 30 days extra of healthy life sounded a good deal at the time. So I kept my mouth shut to the other vault participates about the hopelessness of the task ahead of us. Let them believe things would be all right.

But then the day came, and we were all rushed to the Vault. Ushered into a room with what Vault Tech claimed were ""decontamination pods"". I'm not an idiot though, one didn't decontaminate with liquid nitrogen and some of the other stuff I could see attached to the pods. No it was clear they were going to put us in cryosleep, and considering they were blatantly lying about what these pods were it was clear to me we were going to be sleeping a bit longer than thirty days.

Again, I say nothing to the other participates because I get what Vault Tech is doing. They are trying to keep people calm, and know that 30 days in the vault just won't cut it. They don't know how long exactly will cut it but by freezing us they can then have the computer systems monitor the radiation outside and automatically revive us. It's dishonest what they are doing, but we will at least be alive and perhaps with some actual chance of survival.

But let's bring us up to today. The system began an emergency revival protocol, because the life support had gone into critical failure. Unfortunately I was the only one it was able to revive in time. I've always had a bit of that two edged luck. Sure I'm lucky I'm alive but what now? Everyone else is dead.

Once I got calmed down from the shock of what was going on, I decided to trust what Vault Tech had planned for us. We had been suppose to rebuild once we got woken up. So I was the only one that survived. Always knew it was likely that some of us wouldn't make it and that it was a fairly lost cause, but this is what I signed up for. Time to get to work.

Logic, and Vault Tech's instructions were clear. Assess your surroundings once the vault is opened, keep an eye out for useful supplies, and set up a beacon to contact any other survivors. So it was time to head back to Sanctuary to find out what if anything remained of it.

October 23rd, 2287 - Only think ""alive"" I found in Sanctuary yesterday were mutant bugs and a robot that had me mistaken for one of the other vault participates. I then spent the rest of the day (well into the night) and most of today just sorting through the rubble of what was left of the place. It was clear people had attempted to set up a home here, even found some graves in the back yard of one of the ruined buildings. But something scared the survivors away as I found the skeleton of a man holed up in one of the buildings clutching onto a gun. ((OOC: Random note, with my 10 luck this gun is a 10mm, every other time I've played it's just been a pipe gun.))

Whatever it was that scared the survivors away, I'm not sure. It must have bee years ago though as there was no signs of recent life in this ghost town. Other than that one worrisome thing, I see no reason to think this a bad place to start rebuilding. With Sanctuary being on an island it seems likely that if any threat does come this way it'll be funneled in from one of a few places so assuming people actually show up, it shouldn't be hard to defend this place from any outside threat.

It was a bit annoying that despite Vault Tech wanting us to rebuild they hadn't thought to stock the Vault with a working beacon that all I would need to do is turn on, but luckily I managed to find everything I needed to cobble together my own along with a generator to keep it running. That generator was even kicking out enough juice that I was able to also have it power a crude water purifier I was able to build. ((OOC: Annoyed note, I never did find any Crystal in Sanctuary despite save scumming for hours with that root cellar. Ended up sneaking over to Concord and taking a camera from the Speakeasy while avoid all encounters and doing no looting))

After getting those things up and running I started to work on a garden with some plants I thought might be safe to eat. To my surprise while I was digging in the soil I looked up and saw a traveler walking along the road toward me. Turns out that she was heading North while looking for a safe place to settle, and most the places she had checked out were already occupied by raiders, crazy robots, or mutant creatures. I assured her that there was only crazy robot here and that the extent of its crazy was that it thought I was someone long dead. As for mutant creatures and raiders, I admitted I had only seen a few big bugs but dealt with them easily enough.

I didn't tell her this talk of raiders actually concerned me a great deal, instead trying to assure her that this would be a safe place to live. I promised her the next task on my list was even to build an automated turret and told her that if she could take over with the garden that I would tend to the defense. Turns out though that from all the salvaging that I did yesterday and today, that I only have enough working circuitry for a single turret. If it's just me and her living here, then I think it should be enough to keep us safe, but if more people respond to the beacon we'll start being to big of a target for that to defend us properly. Just to be safe though I gave her a shotgun I had found in one of the houses with what ammo we had for it. I explained to her that I was into the science stuff like building these turrets and so this gun and what little ammo we had for it would likely be better in her hands. I just hoped she didn't decide to use it against me in my sleep.

As I lay here in my sleeping bag at the end of the day looking up at the stars and reflecting on the past couple of days I realize something... It's not a good thing that I can see the stars through the roof of this building. Tomorrow I'll need to work on repairing some of these buildings before we ended up sleeping in the rain. Perhaps even build ourselves some proper beds.

Level 2 - Perk point in lock pick so I could access all the locks in Sanctuary.",Mayor Hopgood [Sanctuary Challenge Part 2]
3346,d73zv,20183,False,False,True,True,GeekyMeerkat,1456,GeekyMeerkat,4ktz1q,2016-05-24 17:15:41,6.0,2.0,"There exists a challenge where a person nevers leave Sanctuary and try to raise up a settlement to 20 people and then going for 100% happiness. There are some various rules for it that people either treat as hard or soft rules. Such as is Sanctuary defined by the build zone or is it okay to explore the entire island as long as you don't cross the water? Can you go for a swim? And other such questions. I've decided to start the challenge myself today and have spent the last couple of hours planning my character and getting through the introduction. Part 1 is primarily just me establishing what rules I've decided to go with, describing the character I built, and also to ask a couple of questions of others.

1. To me Sanctuary is the entire Island and Vault 111.
2. If I take Aquaboy my character is willing to swim as far as to the shores just outside of Sanctuary.
3. If I can see a person or animal from inside Sanctuary I can investigate it (be it a living thing or a dead thing). This is primarily so that once I have a scope I can go get Dogmeat, but it does apply to other things too. I'll be using ""common"" sense on if a mayor would look into a matter or not... I also say people and animals as I'm fairly sure with a high powered scope you can see buildings and what not from really far but living things need to still be fairly close to be noticed.
4. Due to rule 3 IF I get lucky and can see a PERSON in Abernathy Farm using a scope I can go there and trade with them. If not... Abernathy Farm is off limits. (So if all I see is their Brahman that's not good enough.)
5. EVEN if I see a living thing in Concord I may not enter it.
6. Once I get Local Leader 2, I may set up something at Red Rocket. Only at that time may I go in the cave below Red Rocket.
7. Difficulty level will remain on Very Hard the entire time. (Not that I'll be facing many enemies, but I do want them to be beefy when and if I do see them.)

I might be forgetting some situation at this point... I know my zone of places I can go is a touch larger than what is considered Classic for this Challenge, but I don't really want to get all that bored. I figure realistically people would hunt in the surrounding area for things like Ragstag for food, or if they noticed raiders camping out back that they would try to scare them off. My 'if I see it I can check it out' rule isn't meant for me to be all 'Oh I saw that raider a mile away with a super high powered scope time to go kill him and loot anything and everything I see on the way.'

Now who exactly is Mayor Hopgood? Well in my mind he isn't the Sole Survivor that the game describes to us of being a war vet with a murdered wife and missing child. He is though the sole Survivor from vault 111, and he did live in Sanctuary prior to the bombs being dropped. Any dialog Codsworth has with him about his missing child or the like is simply because Codsworth IS a 200 year or so robot and most of those are fairly Glitchy. A little case of mistaken identity isn't that bad considering all the other things that could be wrong with him.

Hopgood honestly has no natural skills in politics, and really only dreams of becoming the Mayor of a rebuilt Sanctuary because of all the comics he's read where a band of people in a post apocalyptic world made it sound easy. That and Vault Tech did rather make a big deal about it being the Primary Duty of all Vault Dwellers upon release to rebuild civilization. So let's talk stats...

I know most people put Charisma fairly high for this sort of build but that's not Hopgood. Hopgood has a Charisma of only 1 to start with. I've made his Intelligence 10, his Luck 10, and his Perception 4.

The high intelligence is so that he gets as much exp from crafting as possible as I don't intend to spam build walls and then deconstruct them over and over. This also lets me fairly early on start putting points in Gun Nut and Science to help unlock things such as the good turrets and the good water treatment.

His Luck is 10 because I've not been able to get a consensus on some things. I know that it improves Ammo and Cap drop in loot for sure. That though I don't care so much about as the primary loot I'll have is in my initial looting of Sanctuary. Others seem to think though that any time the game picks things at random that the good things are a touch more likely to happen with higher luck. So hopefully on my initial looting of Sanctuary it pays off.

As for Perception 4, that was picked because then I can get the ability to pick advanced locks early on and get just a touch more starting loot... and experience for picking those locks. Really that's the only reason I took it, and will likely only ever put that one perk point into perception.

Lastly on the Stat front, the reason for the 1 Charisma is I realized I don't even need Charisma for a few levels. Sure if I set up Red Rocket sooner I could put a supply line to it fairly early on... but this isn't the Red Rocket Challenge this is the Sanctuary Challenge. So Local Leader 1 does basically nothing for me. If I want Local Leader 2 as soon as I can get it (Level 14) this just means I don't even have to think about Charisma until level 8.

Sure if I don't get lucky and find some Charisma clothing the most number of people I will be able to have working in my settlement before level 8 is only 11... but is that really that bad?

But now my questions... really only one burning question. I found out that I can store the baby book in the work shop from build mode so I don't actually need to pick it up and read it right away. Ideally I would use it to buff up my charisma to 11 once I get it up to 10... but I also found out you can only do that if you debuff your charisma from 10 first. The ONLY drug I know that does that is Daddy-O. I know that Solloman in Diamond City will sometimes sell it but I can't go visit him. Nor can I go grab it from any of the known locations where it might be. But does anyone know if a Settler at a Level 3 Med Stand will EVER sell it?

For my less burning questions, are there any considerations I've not taken into account that people feel I should?

This has caused me to wonder something...

Sanctuary is one of the few places we see before the war and after the war. From this we can see that not only has everything aged, but we can see a number of items have been moved around. The stuff in your own house could easily be attributed to Codsworth rearranging things endlessly, but the rest of the town is a little curious.

For example there is one house where you can find a skeleton of someone holed up in a corner with everything stacked up to provide some cover.

So I got to thinking, why is Sanctuary empty for the most part? It's clear people have TRIED to live here and failed. You don't find gore bags or anything so it's not like everyone was scared away by Supermutants. You also don't find ghouls anywhere in the town so it's not likely that they were the cause. Raiders would have set up camp if it was them, and as a matter of fact Codsworth even mentions he has been out towards Concord and that they have taken pot shots at him...

So I have a theory on why nobody lives here when you show up... Codsworth has gone insane when you find him. Your presence snaps him out of it, but what exactly was he doing for 200 years... I suspect that it was Codsworth scaring everyone away from Sanctuary. The skeleton holes up in the corner of that one building was likely killed by Codsworth. It's likely that Codsworth even thought he was 'helping the guy'.

This isn't even that unlikely as we know that the Mr Handy model of robots are prone to going insane if not properly maintained. Just look at Andy in FO3 and them making him the Doctor and his accidental killing of one of his patients.

This wouldn't even be the only settlement that people have stayed clear of due to a Mister Handy robot being there. There is the settlement entirely ran by Mr Handy Robots, the settlement with Goodfeels, and then of course the General Atomics Galleria (not a settlement but still lots of Mr Handy Robots).

We know that the Commonwealth has a general fear of Synths, but it is likely some of that carries over to any intelligent robot that is operating without someone being its master. And considering most settlers have at at best a modded pipe gun, even a single Mr Handy like Codsworth or Goodfeels would scare most people away from Sanctuary.

But now there is one last question I don't have a theory to... how did Codsworth stay in such good repair? We've seen other robots with technicians that have held up far worse than Codsworth has with no technician. Mr Andy and Old Rusty being prime examples... though to be fair Old Rusty's most recent technician is a chemadict and is likely the primary cause of Old Rusty being in the state that its in.",Sanctuary empty for nearly 200 years?

I would love to see a system in place that is much like how FO3 and FONV worked, where as your weapons got damaged you could repair them using weapons of the same class, and that damaged weapons wouldn't be as affective.

My main desire for this to exist is actually because of the institute guns. On many play throughs the first time I get a real laser gun is when I go with Dance to get the communication relay thing and fight a bunch of Synths. You might pick up one of the institute guns then in the hopes of testing it later when Dance isn't about to mess up your test, but as soon as you finish the quest he gives you a weapon that is instantly better than any of the institute weapons you might have gathered...

Okay so you think, perhaps if I fully mod one of these institute weapons it'll be better than a non legendary laser gun that is also fully modded... nope the laser gun always beats out the institute guns. To me this is very odd as the institute are suppose to be these uber scientists and they are building sub par lasers?

But if durability was back in it wouldn't be hard to keep an institute gun fully repaired considering that you get so many of the guns from a single mission. The laser gun type that Dance gives you though are a touch more rare, and would thus be a bit harder to keep in top condition.

Suddenly there is a reason to use the institute weapons over other weapons.",Durability Mod

So to me (not knowing much about behind the scenes stuff for making mods) it seems like it shouldn't be impossible to create a Settler Customization thing we could put in our settlements.

In my mind it would work sort of like how the robot workshop works in that you would go over to it use it. It would then give you a list of all your settlers, and you could then pick one and it would then go into the character customization thing but instead of being focused on your character it would be focused on the NPC.

After a grace period, and as our agreement provides, there's a $10 charge for each 50GB of data you use over the allowance amount. The maximum overage charge will be $100/mo. If you choose to bundle your U-verse Internet with DIRECTV® or U-verse TV you will be provided an unlimited Internet data allowance with a $30 value at no additional charge, as a benefit of bundling.

But there are some key things I want to point out here that come off as very strange to me:

> we will be increasing the U-verse® Internet data allowance for many customers

and

> there's a $10 charge for each 50GB of data you use over the allowance amount

But no where in the email does it indicate what the increase in data allowance is, but now here's the strange thing... when I signed up for my internet I know that I asked for unlimited internet access, and that the sales person told me it was unlimited. However I look at https://www.att.com/support/internet/usage.html and I see that AT&T is making the claim that my data cap has always been 150 GB and will remain such after this change over.

Now perhaps the sales person told me it was unlimited because either they just simply didn't enforce the 150 GB data cap, or because they felt I would never reach it. And I just reviewed all my bills and don't see myself ever having been charged for going over the cap. But, AT&T offers no ability to see how much Data I've used in a given month. On their website there is a button to click that says 'Current usage' or some such thing but all it does is show me how much money a given months bill was. Not how much data actually got used in that month.

So I have two questions... first can someone explain to me what is going on with this ""updated usage allowances"" because to me it sounds to me like this isn't any sort of increase in data for me, but instead just another way to charge me more money.

And second, does anyone know of any GOOD and FREE monitoring software that I can put on my computer that will help me keep track of how much data my network is using, so that I'm not just needing to trust AT&T when they say that I've used enough data that they need to charge me some extra money.",Updates to Internet usage allowances

What I would like to do is claim Sunshine Tidings Co-Op, and NOT set up a recruitment beacon there. I would then search my other settlements for any Synths and send them all to that camp where I could keep them all in a nice concentrated area.

I really want to then set up an arena for ""their"" entertainment. It would be even better if there was a way of trapping Synths like you can trap raiders, so I could get them all of my Synth settlers full sets of Synth armor easily.  I would also perhaps set up some big robots to act as guards for the settlement... perhaps setting up a number of Red Team platforms for each of my robots so I know where they are at all times.

One of the things I'm doing is looking at all the foods listed on the wiki trying to figure out what the ""best"" foods are, and so I'll be sharing my findings with you. All foods with special effects other than ""heal"" are considered on their own terms as the use of those is dependent on the situation.

Considering that I know we need to eat a whole bunch in the new Survival Mode, the first category I decided to look at was what food can I carry in bulk for the best healing. For this one **""Squirrel on a Stick""** wins with a weight of .1 but healing 45 HP. ""Iguana on a Stick"" comes in a close second with the same weight but only healing 40 HP. ""Squirrel bits"" comes in 3rd, but considering it only takes a touch of wood to make the stick version of, this one should not be crafted.

Next up we consider what has the best HP/Weight ratio, and again ""Squirrel on a Stick"" wins, but if we ignore all the food that has a weight of .1, we find the one with the best ratio is **""Ribeye Steak""** with its weight of 1 and it healing 110 HP. Even better with the Wasteland Workshop we can now set up Brahmin traps in our settlements making it easy to farm the meat for these Steaks.

Finally for foods that only heal, I considered what food heals the most and is easiest to farm either because we can make everything we need for it at the Settlement or because every thing we need for it comes from a very common enemy. For this we actually have a tie between **""Noodle Cup""** and **""Mutt Chops""**, with both having a weight of .5 and healing 40 HP. If one is in the New Survival mode, Noodle Cup wins out as Dirty Water is even easier to get in that mode.

Next, for consideration were all those same things, but this time allowing the food to have rads, as perhaps we are taking the perk that removes rads from food we eat or we just don't care about the radiation.

* Bulk Carry w/ Rads: Deathclaw Egg - 45 HP, .1 weight
* Best HP/Weight w/ Rads: Stingwing meat - 65 HP, .5 weight
* Best Farmable w/ Rads: Blamco Brand Mac and Cheese - 20 HP, .1 weight

Okay so you can't really ""farm"" BBM&C, but considering that anything this list that was more easily farmed could be used in some recipe that would make it better, BBM&C was the best thing left. So for foods that give Healing at the cost of Radiation, there really is never a reason you should be eating this stuff. Nor does it seem to ever be worth it to get Lead Belly.

This leaves just one last set of foods to consider. This being the foods that grant additional special effects beyond Healing and Radiation. For this one is a bit trickier as the specials that you might get might be more useful for this build or that build. That being said some effects are more universally good, while others have very limited usage.

Pretty much any of the foods that give a special and have a weight of .1 are great for Bulk Carry, but some that stand out. **""Mirelurk Cake""** for instance provides the best HP/Weight ratio out of ALL items in the game giving 140 HP per .1 weight. Its breath underwater trait isn't that bad either. Of all the foods in this category, I would say the worst is the ""Radscorpion egg omelette"" as it just doesn't provide that great of healing (only 75) and it's special is simply that it cures addictions.

For the Best HP/Weight consideration, again ignoring foods that weigh .1, we actually get **""Stingwing filet""**, with it healing 130 HP, having a weight of .5, and a special of +1 to perception. Overall not to shabby.

Finally for the best food for farming, I would actually say that two items jump out. First for hunting animals I would say go with **""Grilled Ragstag""** (with waste land workshop you can even set up traps for them in settlements). This food stands out so much for survival mode not because of it's ability to heal but because it increases carry weight by 25 and as we know there isn't any fast travel. But even using as a healing item it isn't to shabby with it's 120 HP and weight of 1.

For growing on the farm though, **""Vegetable soup""** is nice, though perhaps not that great. Sure it heals 55 HP and gives some rad resist, but it also has a weight of 1. IMO you are better off growing what you need for the Noodle Soup, as it's got a better HP/Weight ratio and takes less ingredients. This means with the exact same sized farm you can make twice as many Noodle Soups.

**SO TLDR:**

* BEST BULK OVERALL: **Mirelurk Cake**
* BEST HP/WEIGHT OVERALL (W/ WEIGHT > .1): **Stingwing filet**
* BEST HUNTED OVERALL: **Grilled Ragstag**
* BEST GROWN OVERALL: **Noodle Soup**

I need your help :(  I'm having trouble with the pairing sequence (the 5Ghz part as far as I can tell). The software takes a long time on the ""System Load"" portion (the third icon in the sequence). I hear the USB connection sound from my PC, usually twice, followed by USB disconnect, twice! After a while it will usually complete the VR Connection (five-ten minutes, and a few failures maybe) but only for a few seconds,then disconnects, asking if my battery is connected and says it can't find the HMD. Then it eventually connects properly, usually after a few disconnects and is connected SOLIDLY for hours!
I can ping the router and the headset. When the TPCast software says it's connected it pings the headset in 1-2ms, but I can still ping it when it says the connection isn't complete, about 10-100ms.

So far I have tried: 

1. Defaut router config (tpcast router between my main router and PC)

2. TPcast router on a separate subnet, connected to PC though a USB ethernet dongle)

3. Replaced TPcast router with another 5Ghz router, setup as in 2, with ssid, password and ip address as TPcast router.

In all three of these setups I have achieved the same result, I can connect but with great difficulty (half an hour or more waiting for the solid connection). Once it's up and running - NO PROBLEMS!! Maddening.

I've checked and there's no other wireless traffic on the channels I've tried setting the router to.

If anyone has any ideas I'd be very grateful for the help, thank you.




EDIT: While I can't guarantee this will work for everyone, I found a SOLUTION that helped me. Firstly, this is with Setup 2. detailed above. I opened the TPCast router settings and change the range of adresses assigned in the DHCP section from 192.168.144.100-200 to 192.168.144.88-200. Then I created an address reservation for the TPCast mac address on 192.168.144.88, and restarted everything. First router fully boot, then battery into TPCast (and give it a minute or two to fully start), then PC. I then started the TPCast software, steam and SteamVR (once it's available). There were a few 'cannot find HMD' messages from the TPCast software but within a minute or so it was all connected and running properly!

I have a theory as to why this approach (re DHCP) might help, but I'm not an expert on networking so I'll leave it to others to speculate. I just know this has made a HUGE difference to me - and what an amazing upgrade to the Vive the TPCast is! :)




EDIT2: Sorry, I should have said to log into the router, go to 192.168.144.1 in your browser, and use the password 8427531 to access. Be sure to go to the tools section at the bottom first and backup your config before changing anything. At least then if you cause any problems making changes you can revert. And obviously I can't be responsible if something goes wrong, but please ask in the comments if I can help anyone else out. Better still, join the discord (link in the comments), there's some great discussion and troubleshooting going on there :)

EDIT3: I've just heard on Discord from someone who tried this and it had the opposite effect, he can't connect anymore. If you're not having serious problems, don't mess with the router settings!",Help needed with TPCast connection

While most bards are masters of beautiful music, a few bards are such terrible performers that they are a curse to their enemies instead of a blessing to their allies.

**List of bardic performances:**

**Off Key (Su):** At 1st level, a discordant bard's performances can be so off key that spellcasters who can hear them have trouble concentrating.  Each round of the countersong he makes a Perform (keyboard, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any spellcaster within 30 feet of the bard must make a concentraition check to successfully cast a spell.  The DC is equal to the bard's performance check.  This ability replaces Countersong.

**Shriek and Shatter (Su):** At 1st level, the shrill sound of a discordant bard's performance can damage physical objects.  Select one enemy within 30 feet to be the target of a Sunder combat maneuver. Use the bard's perform check as the attack roll, and use his charisma modifier in place of his CMB. This ability replaces Distraction.

**Flee (Su):** At 1st level, a discordant bard's performance can be so awful that creatures physically flee from the sound.  Each creature must be within 15 feet and able to hear the bard. Affected creatures flee from the area until the performance is over. They are not panicked, so they do not drop items, and can still take any remaining available actions.

Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, they are immune to this ability for 24 hours.  For every three levels beyond first, the range of Flee increases by 15 feet. This ability replaces Fascinate.

**Inflict Illness (Su):** At 1st level, a discordant bard's act, dance, or comedy performance can cause physical illness in those who see it. Any enemy within 30 feet must make a fortitude save or be sickened for the duration of the performance.  Each creature within range receives a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, they are immune to this ability for 24 hours.   This ability replaces Inspire Courage.

**Cause Offense (Su):** At 3rd  level, a discordant bard's performance can cause great offense in all who hear it. Enemies within 30 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) or be compelled to attack the bard instead of his allies. Due to their rage, enemies make their attacks with a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls. At 5th level and every two levels thereafter, this penalty increases by one. This ability replaces Inspire Competence.

**Cause Boredom (Sp):** At 6th  level, a discordant bard's performances can be so boring that they cause their audience to lose all interest in whatever they are doing.  Select one enemy within 30 feet. They must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) or lose their next action. If the target fails, it takes no action that round. The boredom lasts until the performance ends or the target makes a successful Will save.  If they do make a successful save, they are immune to this ability for 24 hours.  

This ability replaces Suggestion.

**Thunderous Shake (Su):** At 9th level, a discordant bard decides if he can't play better, he might as well play louder.  The sound of his performance causes a minor earthquake in a 30-foot radius around him. The shaking causes the area to be difficult terrain.  At 12th level and every three levels thereafter, the range of this effect increases by 15 feet. This ability replaces Inspire Greatness.

**Make It Stop, Make It Stop, Oh God, Make It Stop (Su):** At 12th level, a discordant bard's performances can be so awful that the audience is willing to do just about anything to avoid them, even self-harm. Every creature within 30 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) or be compelled to do 1D6 points of damage plus its Strength modifier to itself with an item it has in hand.  If it has nothing in hand, it collapses and moans instead.  This ability replaces Soothing Performance and Inspire Heroics.

**Cause Mass Ennui (Sp):** At 18th leve, a discordant bard's performances are duller than a spoon. This ability works like Cause Boredom, but allows the bard to cause boredom in any number of creatures within 60 feet. This ability replaces Mass Suggestion.

I thought that was a funny idea, so I made a new archetype for him to use. Enjoy!

*************************

**Roadkill (Familiar Archetype)**

If a familiar dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a special ritual.  But if you decide to just keep it around, the familiar gains the Roadkill archetype.

**Intimidating (Ex)**

A roadkill's master gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Intimidate, as anyone who keeps a dead animal around must be a little crazy.

This ability replaces the familiar's class skills, movement speed, and attacks.

**Rot (Ex)**

A roadkill familiar gains the Stench special quality. The master is immune, but his allies are not, a fact that they remind him of on a regular basis. When the familiar's master gains an odd level, add a +1 bonus to the DC as the familiar continues to rot. Ugh, gross.

This ability replaces Natural Armor Adj.

**Dead Immunity (Ex)**

A roadkill familiar gains the immunities of an undead creature.  It can no longer be effected by mind-affecting effects, nonlethal damage, ability drain, and energy drain. And death effects, obviously. 

Unlike an undead creature, it cannot be healed by negative energy. It's not undead, it's just plain dead. It is no more. It has ceased to be.

This ability replaces Intelligence.

**Eww, He Threw It At Me! (Ex)**

While the roadkill familiar is within arm's reach, its master gains the Throw Anything feat.  If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can use the familiar to deliver the spell by hurling it at someone, the creepy weirdo. 

This ability replaces Alertness and modifies Deliver Touch Spells.

**Is He Talking To That Thing? (Sp)**

Even though his familiar is dead, the master can still talk to it. It just won't respond. Anyone who overhears this bizarre, one-sided conversation must make a will save or become too creeped out to attack the master for one minute. Treat as the Miserable Pity spell

This ability replaces Speak With Master and Speak with Animals of its Kind.

Despite all his powers, the sight of flashing swords and flying arrows chilled him to the bone. Not wanting to abandon his adventuring friends, he searched his books for a way to contribute to battles while avoiding the risk of being attacked himself.

After weeks of thought, at last he had an idea. He would return to Wizard College and pay one of his old professors to transform him with Flesh to Stone. Once he was a statue, the professor would cast Shrink Item and Permanency, making him small enough to be a chess piece. Finally, the professor would reanimate the wizard with Stone to Flesh. 

As the wizard was a gnome, he was already quite small. This combination of spells would turn him from a small creature to a ""super fine"" creature of only three inches in height. His size modifier to AC would make him as hard to hit as the party's fighter. Not that very many people would be attacking him. He would be so tiny he would have a +20 to stealth, making him almost impossible to see.

""But wait,"" the rogue said. ""There's a problem with your plan. At that size, you would need to double move just to cross a single space! I'm not waiting around all day for you.""

""I can help!"" the fighter said. ""My helmet has some extra space at the top. You can travel on top of my head and I'll carry you everywhere. I'll even drill some holes so you can see out and cast spells. Won't people be surprised when my helmet starts shooting lightning at them!""

The thumb-sized wizard agreed. He had his books, bed, and scrolls shrunken and moved them into the fighter's helmet. Unfortunately, the fighter had some personal hygiene issues. The wizard was attacked by head lice and killed instantly.

The spell Mad Monkeys summons a swarm of tiny monkeys. According to the rules, ""A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature... A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures"".  

When you cast a summoning spell while using a Rod of Giant Summoning, you increase the size of your creatures by one step. So instead of a swarm of 300 tiny monkeys, you have 300 small monkeys that no longer qualify as a swarm. This makes them *300 separate creatures.*

Clearly, 300 small sized monkeys cannot fit in a single space. I would doubt more than five could be crammed into a single space, even if you took Skill Focus: Monkey Cramming.  

So, when you use a Rod of Giant Summoning to cast Mad Monkeys, 300 monkeys explode into the surrounding 60 spaces. Your enemies would not be able to do anything without provoking attacks from roughly 40 to 50 monkeys. Even if an enemy's AC is too high for the monkeys to hit, the wall of angry monkey flesh would be a pretty effective meat shield.

(Of course, any GM would be insane to allow this, but it's fun to think about.)

A gazebo golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the Fire descriptor, or summoned swarms of termites.

**Relaxing Grapple (Ex)**

A gazebo golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check.  This opponent must immediately make a DC 30 will save, or be forced to do nothing but drink tea and relax for five rounds.  Escaping the creature’s interior requires a DC 25 escape artist check, knowledge:engineering check, or profession:carpenter check.  Alternately, captured opponents can set the interior of the gazebo golem on fire. They will be released once the gazebo golem takes 20 points of fire damage.

**ECOLOGY**

Environment: back yards, parks, gardens

Treasure: 1D6 lawn chairs worth 10 gold each, tea set worth 30 gold, Frisbee on roof

A gazebo golem is constructed of common local woods, assembled into a roughly humanoid body with articulated limbs, and painted a tasteful shade of white.  They are usually constructed by gardeners whose stressful jobs have driven them insane. The golem is programmed to help everyone it encounters to relax - if necessary, by force.

While inside the gazebo golem, its tea cups are automatically refilled by magic. Once they are removed, they lose this property.

-For a whole day (at my discretion), let me touch you under your clothes whenever I want.

We booked the inspection a week after the call, à 8:00 AM and I clearly told them the model and year of my bike.

So, one week later, I bring the bike in at 8:00AM. I am ignored by both the guys at the service desk for 20 minutes, while I'm there sitting on a chair right in front of the desk, they casually talk and answer phonecalls.

I end up filling the papers and tell them I would come back at noon to get the bike. They told me they would call me once the bike is ready. I call them at 12:50 asking if the bike is ready, they tell me it *should* be ready this afternoon and that they would call me.

At 2:40 PM, they call me telling me the bike is ready, but the oil change hasn't been done. They don't have a compatible oil filter in stock for my bike.

How couldn't they tell me that at 12:50? Or during the week? Clearly, they didn't even touch the bike at that time nor did they take the time to check their inventory. 

What pisses me off is that for a simple inspection, where most of the job is tightening stuff AND the oil change, they didn't even do the oil change and took the whole day to do that. I had to cancel a long motorcycle trip with friends beginning in the afternoon because I didn't have my bike. It happened Thursday last week, and they just called me so we can get the oil change done, but by now I'm already at 1900km (1200mi) with the first oil and I really dislike the effects it could have on the bike overall. When I went to the dealership I was at 700mi (~1150km) which was fine by me.

If I had known this dealership was so bad, I would've rode the whole 1000 miles (500 to go and 500 to come back) to get to the dealership where I bought my bike and get the inspection done there.

I can't wait to see how much they'll charge me for this (they didn't want me to pay when I went to get the bike back last week) and how long it'll take them for the oil change. I'll be sure to do it myself next time.

I feel like they did absolutely nothing with the bike except putting dust and sand on it (it was all dirty when I took it back from the garage).

**Update**: Took them 1h30 to get my oil change done this morning, while I'm waiting in front of the desk. I took the change and bought a gallon of oil (48$ - Kawasaki S4) right there while waiting (would've bought more, but didn't have much space in my backpack). I'm done with them, ~205$.

I had a ZX-6R 636, I sold it because of financial issues. Now I can only afford smaller bikes (YZF-3R, Ninja 300...) and after watching a few dozen of videos I came to the conclusion the 300 was a good idea.

I was in love with the 636 because of how easy it was to lay her down in a corner while keeping quite a good speed, can the same thing be achieved on a 300?

Can I still have fun on a 300? I know the acceleration and top speed will be quite different, but how is the handling of the bike when being more aggressive with it?

I'm already (almost) fully geared since I had the 636 as a first bike (totally love it, would get an H2/ZX-10R if I could afford it).

The equivalent resulting colors (MatrixRed being red, etc) are the following:

Green: **#FFFFFF** (white replaces elements affected by MatrixGreen)

My girlfriend is is 21 years old.  
She's a female and is about 5'5'', 130lb (59kg).  
Race: White? (regular Canadian).

--------


Duration: She woke up at 4:20AM to go to the bathroom, saying she had an acute pain in the belly area. She's in her period so I didn't really mind at that point. She woke me up in the process.  

About 3-4 minutes later I heard loud bangs (she hit the trash can in the bathroom when the wall, then fell on the toilet.).  

After she went to the toilet (~2-3 minutes), she tried to come back to our bedroom but missed the door and continued walking in the living room towards the wall, hitting some objects while walking.  

I tried to grab her as I saw she was falling on the ground (happened in 5 seconds).  
She was laying on her right side and I gently moved her on her back. I'm not sure, but I think her eyes were dilated. For a few seconds, she didn't seem to even know I was there.  

After that I took some small towels and soaked them with cold water as she was complaining it was really really hot in the room (she was topless with pajamas bottoms) although she wasn't moving at all. I put one towel on her forehead and one on her chest.  I also came back with some pillows since she was laying on the ground, to make it more comfy for her.
She did not even *slightly* react when the cold towel touched her skin. She had no signs of sweating. It took her about 20 seconds before she was ""back"" mentally. 

She does not remember anything between the the time she stood up and left the bathroom and then realized she was laying on the ground.

At ~4:30AM (I told her to rest a little bit on the ground and kept watching her and gave her water too), we went back in bed.

Medical history: She had kidney rocks last year. She's awaiting for an appointment that will tell if she has the Crohn disease since her mother does.

Current medication: Allesse 21 birth control pills. Nothing else.



Thank you very much for any feedback and even for taking your time to read this thread. I'm kind-of worried. She's fine this morning (8:45 AM) and never did anything like this in the past.","Girlfriend woke up at 4am, went to the bathroom and partially lost consciousness, hitting the walls twice and falling on the ground."

Bought several new external, portable harddrives (3*2TB).   

Until now, I have been using Truecrypt but I'm thinking about moving to Bitlocker.

Several questions for you professionals:   
**When using Bitlocker, there are two modes of encryption offered (entire drive/just the used space). It says newly added data will also automatically be encrypted when put on the drive.**     
1. Is this true even when I move my external drive to a different machine and put data on it from that second machine?    
2. Is that data automatically encrypted? Does it depend on anything?   
3. Must Bitlocker always be installed on the machine for encryption to take place? How does this work?      

**It offers two encryption algorithms (new algorithm/compatible mode). It says the new algorithm *is recommended* to be used for fixed devices but offers better protection, the other for removable devices.**    
3. What exactly does this mean? Can I use the new, ""better"" algorithm for removable devices, too, but can only use it with other Windows 10 machines?   
4. Is either of these options compatible with Linux or Mac OS? Must Bitlocker always be installed on any device trying to access the device?    

**Other questions**     
5. Can I use Bitlocker to create hidden volumes like in truecrypt that can be accessed with a certain password while the real data is hidden?   
6. Can I create/add partitions after encryption took place? Can I add different passwords to these?

Here is a quick video of the noise: https://vid.me/c6ibv

Is this sound the pistons contacting the valves? The noise increases in tempo with RPMs. I was very careful to make sure the timing belt was right according to the Bentley manual but now I fear I fudged it somehow, guessing the valves are bent at this point?

This car did sit for a long time (~9 months) before I was able to complete the repair and the oil looked thin but after adding some more it did not seem to change the sound at all. Everything else about the car seems fine, RPMs are stable, no vibrations or leaks.

###For those who are here looking for information:

Gameplay is RTS, with standardish basebuilding, new and interesting system of acquiring land by dragging islands around, majesty style combat with units that you recruit but do not directly control (they can be indirectly controlled through bounty flags that you can place).

###For other players:

Upgrades are really important. My economy was shit until I started upgrading buildings, I thought I could just expand with tier 1 buildings to a bunch of islands. That is not sustainable. Fixed maintenance costs stay the same even as you upgrade buildings. So 3 level 1 buildings full of workers will have 15g maintenance plus the cost of those workers. Whereas 1 level 3 building will have 5g maintance plus the cost of those workers. This is probably most important for the housing buildings since they form the basis of your gold income. 

Infrastructure buildings bonuses stack. This is most useful for farming. I had one large island with 4 farms and about 10 mills around the outside of the island. It was enough to support a population of like 150 people.

Bird and dragon nests are incredibly value since they provide mounts for your units. Drastically increases the speed of your units simply because they can fly directly to where they need to go.

Magic and gold are the only renewable resources, everything else can be used up.

Check the tabs at the bottom of the building flyout menus. Second tab usually has buyable equipment for your heroes.

###For Devs:

####Problem: Conga line of death.

Heroes will walk up one at a time and get killed by a group of invaders. I want to focus on this problem because how you choose to solve it will dictate what kind of game you are making.

I'll start with the solutions that the majesty games used, because they had this same problem:

1. Slow down combat. If units have higher health, less damage, or slower attack speeds it will slow down the overall pace of combat. This allows reinforcements time to arrive without having everything killed off before they can respond. I think the combat in the game is already relatively slow compared to other recent RTS games like Northgard, so kudos on that.
2. Offer fast travel options. Majesty had scolls of teleportation that heroes could buy. The barracks also had a bell that could be rung and it would recall all the warriors to outside of the walls. I think it would be neat in this game to set up permanent island portal networks (maybe with a maintenance cost of magic power).  
3. Make combat encounters less dense but more frequent. Right now barbarians or an enemy town will open up a portal and pour a bunch of troops in. They have a single concentrated attack, and to make that attack challenging to the player it has to be powerful enough to require a concentrated defense. Majesty typically made it hard for you to completely funnel attacks into one area, you'd typically be fighting a constant wave of low level attacks that benefited from having your heroes spread out. I think this might be harder to do with the way islands work. This game fits much more naturally as a game about chokepoints.
4. Defense flags. Money provided to heroes based on them standing around a flag and defending it.
5. Majesty 2 used a party system. Heroes would gather at Inns and the player could assign them to a 4 person party. That party would always stick together.

Now, some non-majesty-esque solutions:

1. Giving players more control of units. I'm against this because I've really been waiting for games like majesty to come out. Would hate to see this gameplay go away.
2. Telegraphing incoming attacks. Maybe opening a portal takes a lot longer.
3. Island shields. Magic maintenance cost. Prevents enemies from making bridges or teleports to your island. Shield is a building, so enemy can use your own bridges to attack. Shield has hit points so aerial force could hammer it down, or magic attacks can bring down the shield.",Feedback and Gameplay thoughts

**If it doesn't, is there any recourse for them delaying to tell us that?**

We notified them two and a half months in advance. In that email we told them we were moving out either in July (a month away), or August (two months away), and asked if they needed anything else from us before we moved out. They did not respond.

We resend the same email to them 25 days before we are moving out. We ask again if they need anything from us.

They respond 3 days later. They tell us they need an exact date and that we need to fill out a form and turn it in. There is no mention that this form is the only thing that counts as written notice.

Definitions:

**Socialism**: worker, communal, or public ownership and management of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.

**Communism**: a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. Distinct from socialism in that under communism, the community (however constituted) can override and expropriate any particular group of workers or any individual worker.

**Marxism**: a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.

A good story can be a bad litrpg. A good litrpg can be a bad story. They can both be bad, and they can both be good.

Paradoxically I think the https://litrpgreviews.blog/ website tends to heavily review the story elements over the litrpg elements (making me sometimes wonder whether the author of the reviews actually likes the litrpg genre).

I'm going to broadly define litrpg to mean any story set within a game-like universe. And I am further going to say that what makes a litrpg a good litrpg is the degree to which the game-like nature of the universe matters within the story.

Imagine if lord of the rings was rewritten to be within a gamelike universe. Nearly everything remained the same except combat descriptions now included numbers with damage dealt etc. Or imagine the whole thing took place within a super detailed MMO, and this MMO just managed to erase a player's memory of the outside world as they were playing their characters. Lord of the rings would likely remain a great story with these additional elements. However, it would be a terrible litrpg. Because the litrpg elements have no real impact on the story.

Now imagine the opposite for any litrpg book. If you can think of the story mostly working out fine and being unaffected by removing the game-like nature of the universe then it is probably not that good of a litrpg, even if it remains a good story.

_______

Now for some potentially controversial ratings of a couple stories based on how good of a litrpg I think they are:

1. Delvers LLC: 3/5
2. Dungeon born: 5/5
3. Dragon's Wrath: 4/5
4. Everybody loves Large Chests: 5/5
5. Emerilia: 5/5
6. Ancient Ruins: 1/5
7. Chaos seeds: 4/5

I just hope that people take this difference into account when reviewing stories. I personally have a preference for a good litrpg and a mediocre story over a good story and a mediocre litrpg.

""A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself.""

Regardless of why you would use a self replicating probe (exploration, seeding, even extermination of other life forms), if you lose control of their self replication abilities then you are going to fill the Galaxy with an endless tide of your Von Neumann probes. And eventually that swarm is going to grow and envelop everything, including the place where it was created.

Assuming you create a single probe for every star in the milky way galaxy, that is 1 trillion chances for something to go wrong with your probe and set off a chain reaction of out of control self-replicating probes. And it only takes one occurrence.

I think it would be incredibly irresponsible and dangerous for humans to ever create Von Neumann probes, especially if the only purpose of doing so is to explore the galaxy. That is a very minor payoff for a galaxy ruining level of risk.

___

For those familiar with Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" and the two systems of thinking that he presents:

System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, subconscious

System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems
____

I think I consume a lot of media in a System 1 sort of way. I blow through books, movies, podcasts, and music without much thought. I just want to consume it, enjoy it for unspecified reasons, and then move onto something new.

But I think I approach video games differently. I think I enjoy them through more of a system 2 way of thinking. I like to slowly go through the tutorials and learning systems, spend effort looking up the mechanics of the game, and logically work out optimal strategies for winning. 

I didn't always enjoy video games this way, I think I used to have a very system 1 approach to enjoying them like I do for most media. And I still enjoy some games in a system 1 way, but I really look forward to games where I can apply a system 2 way of thinking.

It got me thinking about how I actually picture stories in my mind, and I realized that I only picture certain details.

For example any personally descriptive details about characters are things that I generally ignore. When fans complained that harry potter in the movies didn't have jet black hair, it never bothered me, because despite the clear descriptions of him that way in the book I never actually developed a picture of what Harry Potter looked like. 

I was wondering a few things:

1. Does anyone here know of somewhere on the internet where these different modes of imagining stories have been cataloged?
2. Do you have any details in scenes that you leave out?

If no one knows of an existing cataloging, I was thinking of making my own, and a set of questions to ask people to figure out what kind of imagination they have. I'd guess that a 5 factor personality test might be related to what people picture, and that what they picture would heavily influence what kind of books/stories that they are interested in.

Encounters seem a lot easier than their ratings would suggest. I typically throw encounters at the group that are between hard and 50% above deadly.

CRs don't feel accurate for groups of monsters with varying challenge ratings.

I was wondering if anyone has other systems for calculating difficulty that feel more accurate.

To give an extreme example to illustrate the second point:

10 x monster with 1/8th challenge rating

1 x monster with 5 challenge rating

The encounter challenge rating is 10, but the real challenge in this fight comes from the single difficult monster. The group will quickly take out the peons and it will really be a challenge rating of 5 for the majority of the fight.

I was thinking that a better way for me to calculate this would be to calculate each group of monsters independently. So the 10 monsters of 1/8th CR would have a group CR of 2. And then calculate all of these group CRs together. So the original example I gave ends up being 1 monster of CR 2, and one monster of CR 5, to come out to an ecounter CR of 7, which feels a little more accurate.",[5e] Calculating encounter difficulties

This was the [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3z78zb/two_new_paul_graham_essays_the_refragmentation/cyjw8xz):
>Capitalists follow this circuit:
M-C-M' (that is money into more money through appropriation of surplus value)
Workers follow this circuit:
C-M-C (exchange of commodities using money as a mediator)
This is why inequality is inseparable from the capitalist economy itself.

Where does surplus value come from?

Laborers are paid wages based on the market price of the labor, i.e. how valuable is the stuff they produce (demand), and how many other people can produce it (supply). The traditional econ 101 way to get surplus value in this story is if there is an Oligopsony (single buyer of labor), they would have the ability to drive down the price of labor by restricting the amount of labor requested. Our entire economy is not an Oligopsony so this doesn't fit.

The another way to get surplus value is to assume that the market evaluation of a worker's labor is wrong. To assume that there is some inherent value to labor. 

The labor theory of value is clearly wrong for a variety of reasons. A simple thought experiment shows you why: imagine a specialist carpenter that created beautiful chairs, but used a risky technique for attaching the 4th leg. Doing it wrong would render the chair useless. If the labor theory of value were 100% true then both broken chairs and beautiful chairs would be worth the same amount. If the labor theory of value were 0% then the broken chair would only be worth the scraps of wood that encompass it. The exception that proves the rule: Individuals can choose to value labor subjectively, but the LTV requires that there is an inherent value to labor that ALL people would recognize.

Even Marx ultimately rejected the labor theory of value, falling back on only 'socially valuable' labor having inherent value. The term 'socially valuable' becomes exchangeable with consumer demand and you end up without a labor theory of value, and instead a subjective theory of value. 

Marx retreats back to the Oligopsony argument, but this time the single buyer of labor is a class of people all acting in concert. Its not competing rich guys buying labor, its all rich guys acting together as a single class to buy labor and getting the Oligopsony advantage. And he had evidence for this collusion: businesses were earning average rates of return above zero. This shouldn't be possible in a competitive market, because businesses would compete with each other down to a level where their revenues equal their costs. Somewhere businesses have a value pump, they put something valuable in, and get something much more valuable out after the production process. And Marx believed labor was that value pump. 

**The marxist story is that business owners are all colluding in their own class interest to pay wages to the worker class that are less than what they get out of those workers.**

The major problem with this whole story is that labor isn't the money pump, *time* is the money pump. An economist Eugen Böhm von Bawerk figured this out about 20 years later. Humans have a preference for receiving things now rather than later. To get humans to receive something later rather than now you have to pay them extra, this payment is typically known as 'interest'. There is a natural rate of interest that is basically a market price for paying people to wait for future payment. And a very funny thing happens when you plug in the market rates of interest to the profits of various businesses: the profits tend to average out around zero. 

**The above average rates of return that Marx was using as evidence for class exploitation turned out to be an illusion created by their lack of knowledge about interest rates.**

What if these games are so good because they are hitting on emotional or story themes that are a great fit for telling through a gaming medium?

I haven't played either game but I think I know enough about both to have an understanding of some of those themes that are a perfect fit for the gaming medium. 

**The Apocalypse Setting** It provides an environment that doesn't invite constant comparisons to the real world. Movies can do the real world much better than games can, games can do most environments equally, so doing an environment that people are familiar with leads to them noticing all of the problems with the game world. It also provides a convenient excuse for enemies. Gangs and zombies in a post apocalyptic world, or splicers

**Experience** The process of gaining experience both in terms of you skill at playing the game and the character's skill feels great and natural from a player perspective. As you gain abilities and items your character progresses just like your own skills. 

**Motivation** This has probably been the toughest thing for games to figure out. If the player disagrees with the motivations for the character they are playing as then they will become disconnected from the story, or even try to subvert it. I think both of these games have hit on an interesting and useful story mechanic, a companion protagonist that can drive the story and divert attention away from the player character's motivations. They also both don't go with the silent protagonist trope of video games, which seems like a cop out for solving the difficult problem of player motivation.",An emotional experience designed for gaming

I want to explore that point a little more.

The substance of the argument usually goes something like this: Publishers have high overhead costs, and when they back a game they have to recoup those costs by selling to a large number of people. By having the goal of selling a high volume of units, they have to insist that the game appeal to the lowest common denominator. This often excludes the hardcore and niche fans of a genre. Thus in order to make hardcore or niche games a developer has to go to the fans themselves to secure funding.

Its a great argument, except for one problem: its not true. High over-head costs and the need to appeal to the lowest common denominator are features of SOME publishers, but not all. The simple counter-example is Paradox Interactive which is a publisher for strategy games (mount and blade, galactic civilizations, europa universallis). Their business model is the reverse of the hypothetical publisher that developers are trying to avoid: they make their money by having a high volume of games, rather than a high volume of customers for a single game.

If places like paradox interactive didn't exist, then developers would essentially be arguing that a huge and lucrative investment market has been left untapped, because investors/publishers supposedly want to micromanage the companies that they invest in. I don't find that plausible. I think publishers for many different types of games exist, and if your game has a good chance of being profitable, then you could probably find a publisher that fits the style of games that you are making.

So why are we hearing this line constantly from developers? I think it comes back to the actual advantage of crowd-funding over publisher funding: building a community. Having a community of people on your forums, or to advertise your game for free to their friends is probably one of the most valuable assets acquired through crowd funding. Communities can be strengthened by shared narratives and purpose. What better narrative is there then a small group of underdogs bucking the established order to create something amazing?

I don't think developers are being intentionally misleading about publishers, and there are no doubt some publisher horror stories. But I think it is important that we are actually honest about the history and role of publishers as well as crowd-funding.

TL;DR : a game that can be successfully crowd-funded probably could have found a publisher as well. Publishers aren't always predatory companies gobbling up good developers and making shitty games. Crowd funding is still pretty cool.",The role of publishers in game development

In playground games there is a large open world and you can go do different activities within the world, but you don't really alter the fundamental structure of the world (unless it is done through a specially sanctioned activity). Buildings can't be blown up or built, landscapes are unalterable. Examples of playground games include the Grand Theft Auto series, Saints row series, and the Just Cause series.

Sandboxes are also generally open world that allow you to go explore them, but they are different because the player can alter the fundamental structures of the world. Well known examples would be minecraft, dwarf fortress, or universe sandbox. 

The reason why I think this distinction matters is that sandboxes are very difficult for large studios to make, and playground games are very difficult for small studios (or indie developers) to make. If you see a studio stepping outside of these boundaries I would be cautious. The reason why studio size matters is that a playground needs to be filled with human created content. The human created content offers a consistent experience for different customers and minimizes the risk that certain parts of the game will be broken or not fun for players. A small studio doesn't have the manpower to create enough content for an engaging playground experience, and a large studio can't risk sales based on an inconsistent or less interesting player experience.

There are exceptions, and I think these exceptions tend to occur when a studio has built two games in one. Linden labs is a largerish studio that produced a sandbox playground hybrid. Second life has a real-estate market that is very much not a sandbox since it represents the developer's income. But areas within Second life could easily qualify as a miniature sandbox, where many fundamental aspects of the environment can be altered.

I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on this.

TL;DR:

Playground = GTA

Sandbox = Minecraft

Playgrounds are made by big studios, sandboxes are made by small studios. ",Sandbox vs Playground games

The second option is to continue with normal settings and boot the computer. This leads me to an error message saying that there is something wrong with the boot manager image.

If you haven't heard of it, its an awesome sport especially for swimmers and divers. A game has two teams, 6 players each. They use short sticks (about a foot long) to push a heavy puck along the bottom of the pool into a goal. Players also wear fins to move faster, a mask and snorkel for breathing on the surface, and some basic headgear for protection. Playing surfaces can vary depending on the pool (beggars can't be choosers), but they are usually the length of a pool (25m/25y) and about 5 lanes wide.

I'm an econ major so I think I have a pretty good grasp of the subjective theory of value. The short and sweet is: People's preferences create relative valuations of goods and services, and prices reflect the collective sum of these relative valuations of goods and services. Nothing has intrinsic value, only values that humans assign to it through their choices about  trade-offs.

I don't feel as solid about my understanding of the labor theory of value. If anything is wrong let me know. The LTV in general asserts that prices are some function of the quantity of labor as an input.

I've always been a little sympathetic towards anarcho-syndacilism, but the LTV has been a sticking point. It just strikes me as an ideology driven concept rather then something taken up because of its predictive power. The criticisms I've seen of marginalism and the subjective theory of value mostly fall pretty flat to me, because my background in economics usually has an answer for them.

One last thing: I think someone mentioned that the two things might be compatible. This is true to a certain extent, but if they are compatible, or if STV is true to any extent then it would be disengenous to say that capital owners capture the excess profits from workers, since there would presumably be no way of knowing whether the excess profits came from subjective evaluations or theft of the worker's labor.

To gain a dog's affection, one does not have to put in any effort at all. The dog is programmed to unconditionally love humans, regardless of their nature. This is great. This makes dogs very good pets, and means every dog is a good dog, and dogs are friendly, happy, always loyal beings which adore us and we adore them likewise, in a mutually beneficial relationship.

Now cats are a whole different story. To gain a cat's affection, you really need to go out of your way to prove to the cat that you are a worthy companion. My neighbours have a few cats, one of them stays at our house most of the time (with their knowledge and approval), she is absolutely adorable, loves to play, cuddle, get brushed and stroked. 

This gives the human a sense of pride and accomplishment, for unlocking the affection of the cat.

We never feed her, yet she keeps spending most of her time with us. This means that the animal is capable of presenting affection for reasons more than just mere food or instinct, and means a lot to me. We have bonded over time, slowly, to not just tolerate but be mutually beneficial to each other. 

I bet that a lot of you who suffer from anxiety or depression can confirm how amazing it is to have an animal show it's affection for you, often times unwarranted. It fills your heart with a certain warmth that is hard to describe. I think animals are absolutely amazing, and we often don't give them the respect and love they are owed. 

Obviously with this being said, I think dog people are absolutely fantastic too, full of energy to get out with their animal every day, mostly living active and healthy lifestyles.",This is why EA is right

The platform is 10'x12'. The actual house is going to be 10'x8' with a 4' porch/deck. 4 windows and a door. A flat/slanted type roof.

I'm going to use 2x10 SYP Grade 1 joists 16"" OC with joist hangers.

The SYP Grade 1 beams 2x12, doubled up, into notched 6x6 posts. The doubled up 2x12's will then be bolted into the notched posts using 2 galvanized 1"" bolts. The 12' beams have 1.5' of cantilever on each side, making the span about 8'.

The bottom of the beam's will be about 9.5' high off the ground. The posts & beams are all pressure treated/ground contact. The 4 posts are in 3.5' of concrete.

How does that sound so far?

Here is where I made things even more complicated...instead of leaving all the empty space below the platform we decided to add a 10x8' ""basement"" level to the fort. This level would have 4 walls, 2x10 joists 16 OC just like the upper level. I think my screw-up is the ""beams"" for this lower level - I took a notch out of the 6x6 posts about 2' off the ground in order to rest and bolt the 2x12 beams. So now the 6x6 are effectivly a 6""x4.5"" for a small section. In retrospect - I wish I could undo that step.

I have the 4 posts in concrete already and don't won't to take them up. 

Suggestions?

Are the posts, as they are, good enough considering the 2 levels of joists and joist hangers and beams?

Should I add a post to each of the beam sides for added lateral support?

Thereafter, when we would see him around, we would always give him some money.

Well, she got to talking to him one day and was like - hey, can my husband and I buy you some new clothes and he said, ""No, honestly lady I am so dirty at this point, if you got me new clothes I would just make them dirty so there is no point. Also, I don't have any thing or place to put extra clothes so no thanks.""  

So I thought, okay - solution, this guy needs a backpack.  So I buy a new backpack and get one of those adventure medical kits, put that in there with a canteen, some new clothes, some socks, and even other things like matches, lighter, can opener, water filtration straw, and a multi-tool.  

I figured, if this dude is going to live on the street, might as well get him some useful gear if we are going to help him out.

So my wife gives the dude the backpack and he refuses it saying, ""No lady, that's too nice, I'm afraid I'll lose it. Its just too nice, I'll probably just end up losing it. I don't want to lose such a nice backpack.""  

She tries to convince him with like, its your, there is a medical kit, etc... and the guy just didn't want it.

I don't know why I feel conflicted on this - like okay - the guy doesn't want the pack but we don't care if he loses it - it is his - we are giving it to him, so I guess I just don't understand.

Anyway, no real anger, but figured I would get this off my chest... maybe I'm helping the guy out for the wrong reasons, i.e. my own good will instead of his.

**1'** Liverpool have kicked off, we're underway from Anfield! Liverpool in their full red kit, Manchester United in their grey and white kit.

**8'** End to end football so far, everyone was saying this could be a boring match, but it's anything but so far.

**14'** Wijnaldum with the first *clear* chance of the match, with a FIFA-style shot straight to De Gea.

**20'** Great few minutes from Salah so far, United with the good defence to keep it at 0-0 in the first 20 minutes.

**30'** Matic with a rocket shot, just missing to the keeper's top right, hitting the goal net support upright. About half a meter down and to the right and it would've gone into the back of the net.

**34'** Great goalkeeping by De Gea, with Salah shooting right into him, and the rebound goes wide. Liverpool were really unlucky not to score off that.

**43'** Lukaku with United's first shot on target, Mignolet with the save. United are finally beginning to  push forward.

**There will be 1 minute of added time**

There's also Yannick's utilitarian outlook which is deftly woven into his tactical set up - his defensive set up draws heavily from Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, for instance. The KV Mechelen squad understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to to truly appreciate the depths of the swamp, to realize that they're not just playing a game--- they are building ART. As a consequence people who do not believe KV Mechelen will get Play Off 1 truly ARE idiots-of course they wouldn't appreciate for instance, the brilliance in Ferrera's decision to substitute Kawaya for Filipovic, which itself is a cryptic reference to Dick Advocaat's Dutch national team. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ferrera's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

Christopher Nolan is god.


Fionn Whitehead is some random Englishman. 


The movie starts, he's walking around. He’s like yo where’s these nazi's at?


He and his buds walk around and there ain’t shit as far as you can see. No people, no weapons, nothing, just houses and shit. This is France pre-German conquest. 


Dem Nazis pop up behind them and start like opening fire and shit, you know they up to some shit. (By the way, Fionn’s a soldier in the movie.) He's like ok, i’m just gonna keep running to this house (which represents the safety of French asylum behind the war zone). 


All of a sudden, boom. All of his mates get shot and die. 


Fionn is like yo what the fuck is this, nazis? These are my troops, we built this army, you can’t just shoot everyone on foreign soil.


Nazis be like, nah it’s cool, trust me. He's like well fuck me better run I guess.


All of a sudden, he running and the French resistance are super close. Frenchies are like yo Fionn, i'm gonna shoot you you German cochon and Fionn is like bro lol I'm British, yo can you seize fire? Frenchies are like yo come over, we're all chilling and waiting for evacuation over here. This is the beach of Dunkirk. 


Then a little while later, Fionn walks in on some guy chilling at and they put a guy on a stretcher and he’s got a nasty ass wound right on his ribs. They're like let's get this guy on a boat and try and evacuate on it.


Sure enough, a while later, boom, a boat is here. Fionn is like yo wtf, we need to catch it!? And the security guy at the pier is like yeah, it’s cool, run for it it's about to leave.


But them English are conniving bitches too. They're like oh man, you can never go in there! Leave the sick guy and get the fuck off our boat! So he and the other dude decide to hide below the pier.

Okay so I was gonna keep up this charade and parody the entirety of that absolutely ridiculous post but it's way too fucking long and honestly I can't be arsed. So I'm just gonna call it quits here. I'll keep it up for the last few lines just to fuck with anyone who decided to skip to the end.


Next scene, Fionn wakes up and she’s like yo, where’s this hatred of the troops who failed to fight off the Germans at? But it’s not there, everyone respects the British soldiers because at least they tried. End of movie. 


tl;dr Hitler is a self-righteous prick and accidentally destroys Europe but it’s cool because he can just build another one.

I figured I'd try to find out where the problem seems to lie and whether it's more down to organization or just general incompetence.

Note: since not all of us easily recognize every Liverpool player, let alone Hull City mids who are probably not even at the club any more, I'll usually be referring to them by the colors I assigned to them on my still images. If many of you find something particularly unclear then I will edit this post later.

[1. Hull City (H): 3-1](
https://youtu.be/I0UdzTeHdNA?t=62)

Immediately we notice an odd setup: [black is standing in no man’s land while yellow has to worry about 3 players potentially running into his zone.](http://i.imgur.com/KeqfwgN.png) At the far post it’s a 2 vs 2 situation which is far from ideal. Black should be much further back to deal with no 25 and no 5s run as blue is already sufficient cover for his area. No 5 ends up in the duel which doesn’t get properly cleared. [At this point green (Clyne) has completely let go of his man to track blue’s run which was entirely unnecessary. Woops.](http://i.imgur.com/pcB0l1i.png)

[2. Swansea (A): 1-0]
(https://track4.mixtape.moe/qpdmuu.mp4)

This one actually isn’t bad. [Blue covers the far post man so yellow can help in the center if needed, near post is completely harmless and there’s pretty much no chance for a Swansea overload anywhere, even in the center.](http://i.imgur.com/xhTrm59.jpg) However, blue ends up ballwatching too long and misses his man by about a yard, who heads it back for a rather unlikely tap in complete with questionable goalkeeping. [However, during all this red lets his man chill in an extremely dangerous position at the far post.](http://i.imgur.com/ZaVbQbf.jpg)

[3. West Brom (A): 2-1](
https://youtu.be/I0UdzTeHdNA?t=73)

[Unlike the last example where 5 potential Liverpool players were able to provide cover in the centre, this time it’s only 4.](http://i.imgur.com/HCv2eeR.png) Odd considering we’re talking about West Brom’s airforce here. I think having yellow take over blue’s zone to have blue as an extra man in the middle would have been better, since 2 men entirely dedicated to mark 1 near post man is overkill. A center player ends up rather impressively winning the aerial duel resulting in a goal.

[4. Swansea (H): 0-1](
https://track5.mixtape.moe/gebcaq.mp4)

[Not keen on repeating the same mistake twice, Liverpool now use a whopping 6 men to defend against 3 men running into the center area.](http://i.imgur.com/FqQTy7G.png) The downside is that Fernandez (a center back FYI) is covered by only Henderson who is 7 cm shorter and not exactly known for his heading ability. Unsurprisingly, Fernandez wins the aerial duel. [After that, 4 liverpool defenders fail to cover 2 guys leading to the goal.] (http://i.imgur.com/Tkxawms.png) Very alert guys. At least the closest one could have made an effort.

[5. Hull City (A): 1-0]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G9HHoOkWc4)

So this one is just laughably terrible. [Yellow (Henderson again) has to deal with 3 guys running into his area all by himself with only Emre Can even somewhat nearby to provide coverage.](http://i.imgur.com/G2JBJpR.png) All the while 3 players + the goalkeeper are worried about 1 guy in the 6 yard box. What the hell were Liverpool trying to do here? Did they really think having 5 players run backwards was more efficient than actually, you know, covering their zones? Did a triple substitution just happen and Liverpool forgot to reassign the roles? Were they that convinced they would all go running towards the near post? (Actually we'll get to such a situation later). This shit show also leads to [Red having literally half of the penalty area all to himself a few seconds later.](http://i.imgur.com/vuRER0i.png) If the ball had dropped to that guy and he’d tapped it in Klopp would have deservedly been made fun of for weeks. But alas, it took a far less threatening ball and a goalkeeper fuck up instead.

It’s worth noting at this point that all 5 of these goals were indirect. None of them were assisted by the corner taker and they all needed an extra touch before leading to a shot. At least Liverpool don’t seem to give away too many threatening shots so far. It seems like a lot of these goals are just failed clearances landing at the right place.

[6. Everton (H): 1-1]
(https://streamable.com/o2v83)

[Everton’s short corner threat pulled Red out of position leading to a 3 vs 4 situation at the near post. Yellow has to worry about both his zone and helping out to deal with Lukaku if necessary.](http://i.imgur.com/F2yss87.png) It seems Everton wanted to take advantage of this by trying to reach Lukaku indirectly, watch how the headed pass seems to be aimed wide and how Lukaku rather effortlessly moves past his man to get to the far post. So yellow makes the call to pull away from the center meaning green has to defend number 5 by himself. Unfortunately he (Firmino) wasn’t really paying attention and not only lets number 5 run but also fails to close down the goalscorer immediately after. All around just horrid defending by him. It seems like Koeman must agree that trying to head it through is the best way to score corners against this Liverpool side.

[7. Crystal Palace (H): 1-2]

The final goal Liverpool conceded in 16-17 and it’s by Benteke on a corner, how poetic. To be honest, this one seems okay as well, [with what should be 2 people challenging Benteke in theory (Wijnaldum kind of leaves Can to it a second later), 3 vs 2 on the near post, no far post threat.](http://i.imgur.com/S0C3AS4.png) The goal happens because a) somehow near post man gets a pass through that mess and b) yellow (Emre Can) didn’t think tracking the run of one of the biggest aerial threats in the league 9 meters from your goal was all that important. Note how blue (Lucas) sees Benteke coming but is stuck between deciding to cover the center or the guy annoying Mignolet. He makes the wrong call. Guys, either trust your goalkeeper to deal with the one fella or put a man there to help him out, none of this half and half shit.

This one is odd. [4 vs 2 at the near post while blue is stuck defending 3 defenders at once](http://i.imgur.com/aQ2d03I.jpg) (where have I seen that before?) There seems to be a communication error on who’s supposed to be picking up who. Green, red and blue end up all tracking blue and green target even though someone, probably red (Lovren), should have been tracking Okaka who runs off freely. Lovren and yellow (Firmino) seem to switch targets at the last second. By the time Firmino is with Okaka he is powerless to stop the 180 pound momentum carrying striker. Yet again, the goal took an extra touch to happen.

Also worth noting that despite 3 men accidentally doing the work of 2, [they still manage to let Watford’s number 3 escape to the far post.](http://i.imgur.com/WZfpTbP.jpg)

[9. Watford (A): 3-3]
(https://streamable.com/z5mm6)

Kind of similar to the previous goal, with a striker moving inwards leaving behind a pretty clueless defensive line. [However this time they all run forward making the lack of response by Liverpool’s defense even more inexplicable.](http://i.imgur.com/tpsiBw8.png) Maybe Liverpool were sick of leaving massive gaps at the far post they decided to stay there? Or maybe they were just knackered. Or shite. Anyway, the goal itself seems questionable and rather flukey but it could have just as well been a near post header if the cross was better and Liverpool would have stood no chance yet again. Hell they didn’t even track [this guy’s very late and far run](http://i.imgur.com/RnrB7Vs.png), it’s like they knew they’d concede. Because they’re Liverpool, and that’s what they do. And we wouldn't want them any other way.

Conclusion: Liverpool aren’t great at defending corners, but surprisingly rarely do they ever concede a threatening shot directly from them. The fact that **none of these corner kicks were assists** is a pretty interesting and even kinda ridiculous stat. Most danger comes from bad defending by people who can’t be arsed tracking their man once they see the cross is landing somewhere else. This never happens through the middle, unless you’re West Brom in which case obviously the normal corner rules do not apply.

**TL;DR: If you want to score a corner against Liverpool, aim for your biggest off center guy and let everyone else just run forward to score the inevitable tap in after it doesn’t get cleared.**

Bonus: this didn't lead to a goal but it was still so hilariously bad I found it worth mentioning: [granting Harry Kane a comical amount of mouthbreathing space](https://youtu.be/8DHp-CW-Erc?t=258). Seriously, just look at [this.](http://i.imgur.com/J8HKzZ9.png) Wow.",So I decided to analyze every single corner goal liverpool have conceded since the start of 16/17 to see if there was a pattern. There is.

So as we all know Liverpool have gotten quite a lot of shit for a while now due to setpiece defending, corners in particular. I figured I'd try to find out where the problem seems to lie and whether it's more down to organization or just general incompetence.

Note: since not all of us easily recognize every player, let alone Hull City mids who are probably not even at the club any more, I'll usually be referring to them by the colors I assigned to them on my still images. If many of you find something particularly unclear then I will edit this post later.

[1. Hull City (H): 3-1](
https://youtu.be/I0UdzTeHdNA?t=62)

Immediately we notice an odd setup: [black is standing in no man’s land while yellow has to worry about 3 players potentially running into his zone.](http://i.imgur.com/KeqfwgN.png) At the far post it’s a 2 vs 2 situation which is far from ideal. Black should be much further back to deal with no 25 and no 5s run as blue is already sufficient cover for his area. No 5 ends up in the duel which doesn’t get properly cleared. [At this point green (Clyne) has completely let go of his man to track blue’s run which was entirely unnecessary. Woops.](http://i.imgur.com/pcB0l1i.png)

[2. Swansea (A): 1-0]
(https://track4.mixtape.moe/qpdmuu.mp4)

This one actually isn’t bad. [Blue covers the far post man so yellow can help in the center if needed, near post is completely harmless and there’s pretty much no chance for a Swansea overload anywhere, even in the center.](http://i.imgur.com/xhTrm59.jpg) However, blue ends up ballwatching too long and misses his man by about a yard, who heads it back for a rather unlikely tap in complete with questionable goalkeeping. [However, during all this red lets his man chill in an extremely dangerous position at the far post.](http://i.imgur.com/ZaVbQbf.jpg)

[3. West Brom (A): 2-1](
https://youtu.be/I0UdzTeHdNA?t=73)

[Unlike the last example where 5 potential Liverpool players were able to provide cover in the centre, this time it’s only 4.](http://i.imgur.com/HCv2eeR.png) Odd considering we’re talking about West Brom’s airforce here. I think having yellow take over blue’s zone to have blue as an extra man in the middle would have been better, since 2 men entirely dedicated to mark 1 near post man is overkill. A center player ends up rather impressively winning the aerial duel resulting in a goal.

[4. Swansea (H): 0-1](
https://track5.mixtape.moe/gebcaq.mp4)

[Not keen on repeating the same mistake twice, Liverpool now use a whopping 6 men to defend against 3 men running into the center area.](http://i.imgur.com/FqQTy7G.png) The downside is that Fernandez (a center back FYI) is covered by only Henderson who is 7 cm shorter and not exactly known for his heading ability. Unsurprisingly, Fernandez wins the aerial duel. [After that, 4 liverpool defenders fail to cover 2 guys leading to the goal.] (http://i.imgur.com/Tkxawms.png) Very alert guys. At least the closest one could have made an effort.

[5. Hull City (A): 1-0]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G9HHoOkWc4)

So this one is just terrible. [Yellow (Henderson again) has to deal with 3 guys running into his area all by himself with only Emre Can even somewhat nearby to provide coverage.](http://i.imgur.com/G2JBJpR.png) All the while 3 players + the goalkeeper are worried about 1 guy in the 6 yard box. What the hell was the plan here? Did they really think having 5 players run backwards was more efficient than covering their zones? Did a triple substitution just happen and Liverpool forgot to reassign the roles? Were they that convinced they would all go running towards the near post? (Actually we'll get to such a situation later). This also leads to [Red having literally half of the penalty area all to himself a few seconds later.](http://i.imgur.com/vuRER0i.png) If the ball had dropped to that guy and he’d tapped it in it would have been talked about for ages. But alas, it took a far less threatening ball and a goalkeeper mistake instead.

It’s worth noting at this point that all 5 of these goals were indirect. None of them were assisted by the corner taker and they all needed an extra touch before leading to a shot. At least Liverpool don’t seem to give away too many threatening shots so far. It seems like a lot of these goals are just failed clearances landing at the right place.

[6. Everton (H): 1-1]
(https://streamable.com/o2v83)

[Everton’s short corner threat pulled Red out of position leading to a 3 vs 4 situation at the near post. Yellow has to worry about both his zone and helping out to deal with Lukaku if necessary.](http://i.imgur.com/F2yss87.png) It seems Everton wanted to take advantage of this by trying to reach Lukaku indirectly, watch how the headed pass seems to be aimed wide and how Lukaku rather effortlessly moves past his man to get to the far post. So yellow makes the call to pull away from the center meaning green has to defend number 5 by himself. Unfortunately he (Firmino) wasn’t really paying attention and not only lets number 5 run but also fails to close down the goalscorer immediately after. All around just very bad defending by him. It seems like Koeman must agree that trying to head it through is the best way to score corners against this Liverpool side.

[7. Crystal Palace (H): 1-2]

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into football in the last couple years. So you never watched the GOAT in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: football isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""shooting percentage"" or ""trophies"" I know they know nothing about football.

Ronaldo's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest ever.

So when I hear somebody say that Lionel Messi is better than Cristiano Ronaldo , I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched ronaldo in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched football for a significant amount of time, so I know that ronaldo is better.

You might be jealous of ronaldo's four champions League trophies , or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in football history, or whatever. Unless you're a madrid fan who watched football in the 90s, or a bayern fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win football looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that ronaldo isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Lionel Messi The Best Player in the World™, but leave the ronaldo talk to the adults. Fair?",People on this subreddit hate Cristiano Ronaldo.

For probably as long as they've existed, fan characters have become a meme for many reasons. Whether it be due to the unfortunate sorry excuses that are recolors, eye-melting design of so-called original characters, poorly written backstories, cliche personalities, the abundance of Hedgehog FCs, cringy/bad fanart and fanfiction, or typing in your name into Google; one thing is for sure… Fan Characters get a bad reputation.

I defend fan characters because, even despite these things, I believe every single one, yes, even the bad ones, are good. It's true, not alot of people actually put care into what they've created, but what if these Original the Characters, let's say nearly half, originated out of pure comedy, not poor execution? Then would it be fair to criticize every single fan character in existence? I don't think so. Especially when you take into account that there is, at least, a small portion who put hours worth of research and thought into the character. They will look up color theory to choose the best possible color palette, doodle patterns or details like hairstyles to work out what is actually original design, watch TV shows and movies to get a sense of character development and backstory, read books to write actual good fanfiction, look up tons of names and their origins to decide the best possible name, etc.

This is the difference between just putting this or that together to call it a character and actually giving a character life through means of pouring their heart into creation. I find it interesting that Sonic fan characters are hated more than other fan creations. I don't know why it's so easy to hate on them or why it's so easy to create the fuel of the hatred that is horrible fan characters, but they are a part of a franchise that revolutionized the art of fan character creation. Sonic's unique design has inspired so many characters over the years. But each one is necessary because it gives new creators a means of comparison. Sure, you can laugh at them, but you've learned what not to do and how to better your creation.

This probably sounds like a no-brainer but if it were that obvious, why don't the creators who are trying implement this? Let's not even go into that the majority of FCs could be a product of young imagination that has yet to understand concepts of good writing and art. The simple fact is that creating good characters is tough work. Again, this likely sounds stupidly obvious. But if it were truly easy to create even decent characters, there wouldn't be so many bad fan characters to start with. Sonic, himself, is a tribute to how you do something right. The funny thing is, he started out as simple; no voice but had that cool personality that allured so many gamers. Without the cocky demeanor that made him so appealing, I highly doubt he'd have as big a following as he does today. You can argue over how he's changed since 1991, but in actuality, Sonic has evolved since his conception. All characters need to evolve, or they stagnate and wither into obscurity. Let's use Robotnik (or Eggman, whatever) as a prime example. He kind of represents character creators today. His mechanical prowess is impressive, right? But there's always a flaw in his designs that make them to be turned into scrapheap by our blue hero, isn't there? Obviously, as the villain, Buttnik will never truly master his art and finally rid of the speedy pincushion, but like any creator, he slowly alters his robots to perfect their design so that he can come just a little closer to that goal. Even if his mechanical monsters don't do their intended job, he carefully plans their weapons, Sonic's weaknesses, and ultimately how the robots respond. I think Eggman should influence creators looking to hone their craft, because unlike Sonic's foe, one can achieve their goal of an amazing character. You can create something that wows people. If this weren't the case, fan games wouldn't be a thing. And boy, do I hear lots of high praise about those!

I proudly say I have made characters before, I bare no shame because I have grown in my writing. Even if the only reason for the existence of a character is, for example, to be shipped with canon characters (something I know bothers lots of people), they need to be written where they actually suit the personality of pre-existing characters instead of changing them to suit the fan characters; ending up making them out-of-character. The cliche traits, often Mary-Sueish, can be reworked into memorable and very tangible fictional persons. Not all traits are bad, just overdone and frequently done poorly.

As a creator myself, I can use my experiences to further explain my point.

My old main FC used to be a blue leopard with bat wings, talon feet, color-changing eyes that I named Kat the Huntress who was a crossover character that wielded Halo weapons and was a Shinobi with a number of Justus. Pretty familiarly cringey, isn't it? In my defense, she was exclusively a character that I created for the roleplays between a friend and I while spending hours on the phone, I hadn't expanded my imagination yet at that time, and names are more difficult than creating the personality at times. Years later, I created a Chameleon FC who was a ninja reject because of her uncontrollable color-changing skin, which correlated with her mood. I felt that the small trait I took from an old character might work best with a Chameleon instead. At least it made better sense! Granted, her eyes had the coloration of a rainbow and I shipped her with Espio, but 1. I couldn't decide on an eye color and rather than her eyes awkwardly changing colors with her skin, I thought rainbow would be more appropriate. And 2. I like Espio and I wanted a challenge to make it actually work naturally with him rather than just shipping just to ship.

I also took Kat and created a snow leopard who was victim of hybridization, as I called it, (I have a love for winged creatures so I kept that part of the design the same) by Robotnik himself, who eventually was saved by Sonic and later his girlfriend who I had renamed several times before finally going with Frostfire (she was a pyrokinetic and a cryokinetic, hence the name). As you hopefully can tell, there's some growth here, but more was needed to actually perfect her (ironically, I gave her a form of amnesia and being left into basically cryostasis, but it didn't hit me that I had copied Shadow until I wrote a scene where she discovered her cryotube). Though I didn't change her until a year later, this was the start of realizing she needed real writing done to her. The backbone of any character is their story and shortly after finishing the first fic, I knew I had to make some serious edits to Frostfire that required a complete rewrite.

The next fanfiction I gave her that backstory she needed and I thought very intently about it. Along with that, I also worked on giving her a personality beyond being a depressed wooden character who happened to mirror Shadow completely on accident. The integral piece of my fan character, depth, was something I strived for (prepare for a long tangent). Frostfire was now part of a village of Snow Leopards and Huskies, who were hunters with cryokinesis, and she was basically an INFP in terms of personality. Her backstory now included her being born with pyrokinesis in addition to cryokinesis, as I liked both abilities and wanted her to be distinct from her people. Frostfire wasn't different just to be different, I just didn't want a character with only cryokinesis. Being as her people, known as Kannik, were influenced by the Inuit culture I researched so I placed them in the area on Mobius known as the Northern Tundra. With this in mind, it felt right that her pyrokinesis was seen as a curse, much like Naruto; again, like with Shadow, unintentionally inspired by him. But this time, it felt right. I didn't feel like Frostfire was rushed. She's not actively shunned and feared by everyone like Naruto, but I made it subtle at least. And the biggest difference between his curse and hers is that she actually has always been aware of it. The powers she has are connected to emotion, ice being calm and fire being anger, so any Kannik with pyrokinesis was considered dangerous. I wrote Frostfire’s character to where she was as determined as Naruto (he wants to be the leader of his people, better than all of them in fact) to be noticed as something other than a curse - she just wants to be a successful hunter, though.

Usually many people talk about how not every character needs a tragic backstory, but I say that without something that challenges their goals and dreams, without an event that triggers change in their personality, the character cannot grow and evolve as they are meant to. So instead of dead parents or being last of her kind, I made her brother her main challenge and the reason for her tragic past. Her brother, Auk, is the type of guy that demands attention, begs for it even. Why? Frostfire, being the cursed child, gets all the attention he wants. He wants to be recognized by name and important enough to be known by everyone in the village (I didn't want Frostfire to be popular or anything, just known about concerning her curse. She's still given a cold shoulder by many, after all).

Naturally Auk became jealous of his sister and after one thing after another, he would eventually snap from his need to be important. As a quick note, pyrokinesis is a rarity among the Kannik so it was pretty shocking to see. Auk does not have cyrokinesis and instead has exclusively pyrokinesis (something that was tucked away within) making him not only extremely rare but dangerous, too. His anger became the weapon he used to seek revenge on Frostfire. Since she was known to have the curse and he wasn't, he framed her for burning down most of the village. Frostfire should have been put to death but was spared by the village Chief and instead exiled. This was not because she was literally thrown out of her element. Auk’s hatred would have ended there but he is pure hatred, so he fled to seek out Frostfire to end her once and for all.
The next bit is where things in the story got messy. I wanted to emphasize that her brother was not just mad with rage but also irredeemably evil. So, without much reason, Eggman found him, gave him the hybridization technology used in the previous story (hey, I like hybrids, sue me) and gave her the wings her previous incarnation had before. This was supposed to be as terrifying as, say, rape. Dark, I know, but Auk wanted to create her to be the monster he saw her as. She would eventually awkwardly escape and fly out of the Northern Tundra to where Sonic and friends were (yeah, she meets them but would It really be a Sonic fanfiction without him?). Auk, would, of course, chase her down at some point (how he reached there, I haven't thought about).

Since having the only thing she knows stripped of her, it shook her to her core. Her culture is all she can cling to but now she's in a new place and must adapt. While a large part of her personality was based of me (gotta use what I know), she was, as one reader informed me, very much ended up like Starfire from the original Teen Titans when she was exiled. This definitely changed how she reacted to things. One of which, being romance, as it started as a minor thing about her that grew to be more vital to who she was.

Yeah, I shipped her with Manic, Sonic’s brother, now but, kind of like the previous story, I emphasized relationship development rather than just being like “Oh hi, canon character, you don't know me but you will end up loving me anyway!” And so I tried my best to make her relationship with him work. I even wrote a legitimate wedding scene that tied American wedding traditions and ones made up with her culture but that involved Frostfire encountering her brother, finding out she was framed, and eventually going back home to restore her honor and gain the trust of her people to even arrange a wedding. But I never went into how she travelled with Manic to her home, they just flew there lol (She has her wings, obviously, and Manic has his hoverboard). I did write that she had a son with him, but there was a reason: Anyone that knows Manic is aware of the Sonic Underground episode Three Hedgehogs and a Baby where he ends up caring for this robotic baby, which he names Hip, who gets destroyed and it rips his heart to shreds. So I thought it would be a tender moment of Frostfire heard the story, wanted a kid, basically resurrecting him in a way.

So after all of that, I eventually made Frostfire her own character outside of Sonic, changed her story a bit, kept some parts of it the same, and really tried to refine her. It's very possible that I could have taken a few steps backwards with the story she has now, but she's nothing like the Kat the Huntress she once was. I take characters very seriously, so I am always working to make Frostfire better, and from what I've given you, hopefully the evolving of her character is made clear. And perhaps you have a better understanding of how fan characters can be good, too. Every character that exists that can be altered in a way which makes them more tangible and believable; all characters are capable of being bigger and better versions of what they first began as. It's a journey that never really ends.",Why Sonic Fan Characters Are Good

> Johnson never showed anything near the display of perversion possessed by J. Terry, and Ryan Giggs. He was never the best at making a move, organizing a date rape and wasn't a bit of a nonce. In 2015 Sunderland, this was compensated by the board who suspiciously denied all accusations, and he had several other world-class players to tactically organize his criminal activities when needed, like Lee Cattermole. David Moyes, brought to Sunderland to be the club idiot, gained a worse reputation for them in 1 season than Johnson ever did. People who never watched him week after week forget that.


The fact that Johnson was never caught being a pervert isn't exactly a concrete example of any pedophile ineptness on his part, since he was a classic nonce. The role is kind of lost on the current generation who is used to watching rapists go to jail, but to surmise, a pedo playing such a role in those days was actually given the task of controlling the tempo of the fucking and moving his balls vertically/horizontally as required, from a lying down perspective. The cellphones were generally used to contact the victims by showing his balls and pulling them out, to start a new chain of lovemaking. Hence the term 'kiddy fiddler' as used by BBC for Johnson.

Furthermore, if Johnson was indeed so sexually limited, then I really doubt that he would be consistently asked to play with the tits of 15 year olds (without being dropped mind you for big asses, unlike for instance Debruyne who was famously dropped by his girl for a player like Courtois) for kids who are themselves considered to be very adept sluts. One would think, they would notice these fallacies in Johnson's criminal record. Oh, and it isn't as if Johnson never featured in such a big girl, since he played as a deep lying lovemaker for Stacey in the bedroom. It's just that Stacey soon figured out that Johnson was even better as a classic nonce.

As for the anecdote regarding Moyes, well, when Johnson left for jail, Sunderland used that shame to not only attract Moyes, but Januzaj and Denayer as well (so it wasn't just Moyes' effect which helped them achieve an utter lack of success). And even after that, they still reached only one shit season vs the bunch reached during Johnson's time. Domestically as well, in both their tenures Sunderland won fuck all (since the other relegations for Johnson were avoided due to great escapes, but then Johnson's Sunderland ended up clinching 2 17th place finishes, in controversial circumstances in the last few months, so it evens out).  


> After his 2016 arrest his popularity with casual and new football fans plummeted, alongside thousands of pornhub highlight reels showcasing his godly bad touch and genitals. And this retroactively built a Johnson vs Owen Oyston manufactured rivalry, when everyone that actively watched porn in the 2010's knows that Oyston was miles above Johnson at the time, and the comparisons between them are actually between Johnson and post-conviction Oyston.


Johnson vs Oyston started in 1995, wherein they signed for Newcastle and raped a bint respectively showing a clear love for public embarrassment. Guess who won sweet fuck all, and no Oyston was not stuck in prison that year but the next, though he did suffer from dropping the soap during the showering. And yes, obviously the 2016 conviction destroyed Johnson's popularity and his sexting with the kid was a major influence on fans watching at that time, but that was simply a result of the improbability of it, considering that a 28 year old fucked a kid despite being able to have almost any woman. So the rivalry wasn't manufactured post imprisonment, but was a product of the two best rapists of that generation being pitted against one another in two separate trials and a smear campaign.

Lastly, there was a time before Oyston got imprisoned when he was absolutely inescapable and definitely and rightly considered the best rapist in the world, above even Johnson. But it is also true that at that time Johnson was not at his peak yet, which he reached during the 2015 period. Sadly, Oyston was jailed by then and thus a direct comparison of the predators at their peaks was never made possible.


> He's often credited for fucking a kid even though he was average, lost his erection in the group sex and gave head twice. People are fooled by his elegant humping, but older fans know that he did absolutely nothing up to the statutory rape, and Big Sam was widely regarded as Sunderland's most dangerous inhabitant. In the prison system, he's often remembered for the cumshot against the child and redtube highlight compilations, but what they don't show is that Johnson never, ever had a single truly proficient year where he raped throughout. On this regard, Oyston is a much more consistent player women can always fear.

For a nonce who didn't do much pre 2015, it surely is surprising that he was the highest hated kiddy fiddler (2nd highest overall behind Bill Cosby) with minimum 1 girl raped, by The Sun magazine (a relatively shit source for just about anything) for the 2016 conviction. Source - http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72611000/jpg/_72611944_adam_johnson_eyes_closed_ap.jpg or that the Daily Star considered him to be their cunt of the year. Source - http://www.anorak.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/england-pervert.jpg

As for entire years where Johnson shined throughout, you can have your pick of 2014 (33 dirty texts) , 2015 (20 dick pics and a rape) and 2016 (29 sexts). His victims might have ended up not on his dick in those years, except in case of 2015 when he got to rape a girl, but statistically, his impact on women's safety in those seasons is easily comparable to the consistent best that Marcos Alonso can offer. And in case of seasons wherein Johnson fucked in offensively weaker positions, it actually makes his contributions more valuable to his victims misfortunes.


> He's somehow credited as a ""big name nonce"" even though he only showed up for 2 tinder dates in his whole career, and ghosted most of the others

All that this shows is that if Johnson didn't absolutely take control of the girls' bodies by drugging, they generally got away (apart from 2015 and even there he got more shit than both Terry and Giggs, both of whom are considered to be bigger cunts and were the respective most loathed player for their teams. Which shows how the ""he always played with worse equipment"" argument is also a bit of a phallicy.

In any case, if you hold say Oyston to that same scale, for instance, and give him the same handicap with regards to his victims, he would have a lot lesser volume of noncing, considering that he never touched a kid. Point is, that you have to understand that Johnson was a pedophile, and so having sex with adults was not always possible for him. And if his victims also did not give in to the chances he provided for them, it was hardly his fault. He was definitely not ""invisible"" in all those girl's lives, as for instance he had sexual text conversations with many of them. Thus there are some clear hyperboles in that above mentioned list almost like saying Oyston was innocent after '95.

> tl;dr Johnson is overrated by millennials who only watched redtube highlights, love how ""noncey"" he looked and remember the head on that chick. People who actively followed little girls around before and during the 2010s know better.

It requires a series of things to break, but in isolation none of them are inconceivable on their own

Central to the strategy is preventing Utah from falling into the hands of the Democrats. There has to be a realistic prospect that it would do if Trump runs as the candidate. Now bear with me as I go through what else is needed.

First Florida. Let us assume that Trump through a combination of a local presence there, Ben Carson, Rick Scott and the fact that Obama is more popular and a more dynamic campaigner than Hillary can take the sunshine state. The margins are already tight enough as they are. It only requires a small swing of less than 1%

Lets also assume that John Kasich is spitting nails after April 26th, feels a bit betrayed by the establishment and agrees to run on a Trump ticket and delivers Ohio. Getting him on the ticket looks like being the bigger obstacle than delivering the state

This gives us a score of 285 to 253 on the Romney map

Let's assume that Virginia stays Dem, and bag that blue for now.

Instead let's turn to New Hampshire, Iowa, and Wisconsin and make them unallocated 'toss up' states, we have a tantalising new score of 

Clinton 265, Trump 253

With 6 college votes, this is why Utah becomes critical. It she flips it, it gives her 271. But what if Romney runs there and takes it

Clinton 265, Trump 247, Romney 6

Are there grounds now for thinking that Trump can take Iowa and Wisconsin? If there are we have a real issue developing

I've been struck by just how easy it was to change to both states red using Nate Silvers model. It only required support amongst the non college educated, white voter to rise to about 68-69% from 62% to achieve this, with turnout also increasing not dissmilarly. I think turnout is likely less of the issue. Trumps presence probably guarantees that. Its whether Trump can galvanise this into votes. If he nudges 70% amongst this demographic in Wisconsin and Iowa then he's very, very close to locking these states up. Even 69% or 68% could be enough

If he gets all three, (New Hampshire as well) then we have the following result

Trump 267, Clinton 265, Romney 6

If he fails in New Hampshire and that stays with Hillary we have the following

Clinton 269, Trump 263, Romney 6

Hillary needs either Iowa, a state she's already opined ""don't like me""

On any of these outcomes, of course we suddenly see the constitution kicking in!

The more I look the more confused I get what to buy, and what technique to use to sharpen my blades properly.

I have never sharpened a blade before and don't want to start off by ruining my knife.  I don't know if I should get a knife sharpening system such as the spyderco one or is there a cheaper option that is just as good, or should I just get a wetstone and learn how to do it by hand?

I am not concerned about keeping my knife so sharp that it cuts me just by looking at it, but I would like to learn how to keep a nice edge on my blades without damaging them and keep myself safe by not using a dull knife. Please let me know what you would recommend to someone like myself who has never sharpened a knife before.",Beginner sharpening help please.

i quit streaming a year ago, cause i had many trolls in the channel. They created accounts with harassing names including my channelname. Then they hit the followbutton to get shown on the overlay.
I ignored it, removed it, banned them. They got back with new account, and so on.
But the problem. Everytime, my stream went online, they came back, cause they got the notification, that my stream is online again (even after a week break).
I dont want specific people as followers and sending them notifications!
I reported the problems many times, i sent suggestions to add a remove-followers-function, and i reported avery trollaccount.
The accounts are still existing and twitch never removed them from my channel. So i gave up. If twitch doesnt help with that, i´m out.
**Is it meanwhile possible to remove followers? I dont want to start streaming again after a year and get the same troll again, cause they get an e-mail, that i´m back.**",Meanwhile possible to remove followers?

* Why do i have to put my weapons down while i sprint?
* Why does my character not take his weapons up after i stopped sprinting?
* Why do i have to take up my weapon and my shield seperatly (everytime after 5 meter sprinting...)?
* Why are the animations of the animals so clipped/choppy? The animations are really bad atm. I know this game is EA, but come on...
* Why are the hitboxes so inaccurate?
* Why are the controls while climbings so inaccurate (especially while climbing over an edge)?
* Why has splitting stacks up be so complicate? There is no ""Hold Ctrl+Leftclick for auto splitting up stacks"".
* Why this game has not infos about Npc-Lvl, Strength, Dangerous. I cannot estimate, how strong an enemy is without fighting him and see, how much dmg he does.
* Why are there no infos how much armor i get for different items?
* Why are boxes and bags limited to use for one person? It´s a box. If it is opened, more then one person can access it.
* Why the Clanystem has not more options (maybe it does and i didnt found out yet - if so, sorry). The Clanleader is offline, my friend wanna join the clan. I cannot invite him, he cannot enter the house, he cannot use a bed, he has to wait until Clanleader gets online. Maybe a Co-Clanleader option?

with the next big patch the Map will get an overhaul. Looks fantastic atm for me (walls are still too thick for me personally, but ok), but i have 1 quastion.

Will a part of the map still be revealed for every player personally, or for the whole party?

Can i use a 4linked item for: Cwdt+Enfeeble+Immortal Call+Enduring Cry, or would 1 of the supported Skill get a cooldown, if another one procced?
",Does Cwdt support 2 Skills?

just 2 questions.

* I skilled ""Iron Reflexes"" (Converts all Evasion Rating to Armour). If i am looking for gear upgrades now, is it better to search for items with ""Inreased armour and evasion rating"", ""increased armor"" or ""increased evasion""? Or does all of this make no difference and i should just look on the total number. If i find gloves with 500 Armor and gloves with 250 armor and 240 evasion... The 500 are better? Or does the evasion+armor got any bonuses?
* From lab i got this enchant on my boots: ""Increased crit chance if you haven't crit recently."". I skilled ""Resolute Technique"" (Your hits can't be Evaded. Never deal Critical Strikes.) Is this enchant any good? I mean, i never crit, so i get higher crit chance for another critchance that doesnt exist?!

Hope you know what i mean. Thanks",2 questions about Iron Reflexes and a Lab-enchant

i started Poe again after a longer break. Looked up a guide in the forum and built to it.
It´s working pretty well, but my defense seems to be pretty bad...
Life i really low (~4200) and at some Mapbosses i get like oneshot...
Resistances are all on 75% (without Chaos).
Maybe you could take a little look on my char and tell me, which items you would switch first, which item maybe is totally wrong or what skilltree i should skill next (The guide seems to be finished now, so i have to choose myself).

The missing gem will be Harald of Ash (like the guide says). Goal this season would be Lvl 90 for the achievement and maybe higher bosses (like shaper, which ive never seen before ;) )
Highest map i cleared atm is 9. Trashmobs are no problem, even rare bosses are going down really good, but with map bosses i have rly big problems...

Would be glad, if someone have some tipps or tricks. Thanks! ",Help with my Legacy Duelist

Why not pick up 1 and the system will pickup all in range with same name (like in Diablo3).
* Find partymembers on map - If a partymember is out of the screen, why is there not a little dart on the side of the screen to tell me, which direction i have to run, getting to him?
* Trading - Yes the discussion is old... You have to write with 10 people to find someone, who is not afk, meanwhile offline or busy in maps. You want players to interact? Autocopy a sentence from poe-trade, get an invite without hello, finish the trade and leave without a sentence? Thats the interaction? Just put an auctionhouse into the game, where items will just be listed, while the seller is online and with a maximum amount of allowed items.
* Findout, which item is pro and contra - Why is the no function, which will show me in green color the + and in red color the - of an items compared to my actual item? That would be a huge benefit for trading and gear-progession.
* Maps in stash - The map system is awesome, i love it. But stashes full of maps are just crazy. If i want to find all triple-maps for selling them to get an upgraded map, i need hours. Why not a system with autostacking? Saves space and makes it easier to find the right ones.
* The Overlay Map - I like the Overlay Map (fullscreen), but it takes a lot of screen. Why no option to make the minimap in right top corner bigger? So the screen would still be sclear, but it would be also possible to see the minimap better.
* Male/Female - I know there would be many animations to created, but the possibility to make the characters male or female would bring some freshness into the game.
* Shop-Items - I bought a founderpack and a mystery-box. From the box i got some wings. Fine, that i use the Bringer of Rain-Helmet. With this items i cannot use a chest. For the Armorskin and the wings i need a chest... Cannot use it...

Please dont get me wrong. I love the game. I really enjoy it. But there are so many little things, that make the game unnecessary uncomfortable to play. My biggest hope is the next big update. Hope, we will see some changes in this direction...
Thanks",Just some suggestions from my side.

is there any way to remove specific users from my follower-list?

i just wanted to make a Suggestion for 2 new Goblins. Sorry for bad english - not native speaker. ;)

* 1.: **The Key-Goblin**
He is dropping Greater Rift Keys like the Keys you get after Completing a normal Rift. Another idea of mine is that the keys are locked. So you get fixed levels on them. The Goblin is dropping Random Level Keys. You get 2 Greater 40 Keys, 1 Greater 20 Key, 1 Greater 70 Key... That would be a cool idea to switch a littler bit and dont just run 90, 90, 90, 90... A nice idea for twinks...

* 2.: **The Horadric-Goblin**
He is dropping Materials like the Materials you get in the Horadric Cache after completing Bountys.

Why? To be honest i love Greater Rifts. When my team is online, i just play Greater Rifts with them. Farming the keys is no problem and takes no time, but i would be happy to play Bountys or normal rifts and find a goblin with some extra Greater Rift-keys.

The horadric-Goblin would be just a real cool bonus...

Thanks Guys.",One Suggestion for 2 new Goblins.

**Contact:** I got many contacts over mail from people wanting a personal layout, so my mailbox is exploding. Further some people requested personal layouts for free, i made them and after 2 days they made another one from another artist, so i spent my time for nothing... I created a guestbook on my site, so please post there.

**Status:** ATM i don´t make complete personal layouts. If you like an existing Panel or Overlay from my site and you want me to put your Channelname on it or you like a panel and miss one specific text on it, please post in the guestbook. I will look to do it.

**Other:** I started this website just for my own interest in building websites and combined it with my interests in learning graphics, so the website is not perfect and the graphics are not high-level-super-mega-perfect, but i think maybe someone can use it for the start in streaming or to fresh up an existing channel.
I always add new designs there, so place a bookmark and look on the site sometimes. Have Fun, would love to read you in the guestbook for your opinions.

I started a new Game. For this i joined a guild.
I really like the game and the people in the guild are awesome. We talk a lot in teamspeak, play together, have fun - everything is ok.

After i time i told them, that i stream sometimes on twitch and i´m thinkin about streaming the actual game. From this moment, all of them were against it. It is not allowed to stream while using the teamspeak server, cause i would have to tell every single one, that i´m streaming and that the viewers can hear all people on teamspeak.
I totally accept and i understand that. I also would not like to join a teamspeak server without knowing, that i get streamed on twitch.

So here is my problem...
I found a game worth streaming
I found a community i´m having fun with, what it would be worth streaming.
The people don´t want to get streamed.

Now i found a sloultion. A Software, that is filtering out the incoming Teamspeak. So my Viewers would hear me, but not, what other people say to me on teamspeak. The admin told me, that would be allowed.
But honestly... If i talk to them in teamspeak, my viewers hear that, but they dont know, who i am talking to and what i am talking about is also useless...

What would you do?
Change guild? Dont stream? Go on with the filtering-method?",My problem with streaming and teamspeak.

looking for this so long and still not available!

Please let us delete Followers. I had some trolls in my channel, creating stupid usernames including my channelname (like Bultvsmom, Bultvyousuck,...).
Including this Id*** are following and get shown on screen with streamlabs, everyone finds them, if people are searching for my channelname on twitch.
Ok, i cannot change that! I accept this. I reported them over a week now and twitch is doing nothing. This accounts still exist....

BUT: I dont want them in my follower list! I dont want them to get a mail, when i go live to remember them ""Hej, he is online again, lets get there and troll him again""!

If someone is trolling, following and gets a mail everytime, when the streamer is going live, he can start over and over to create troll accounts.

So:
**PLEASE! Let use remove Followers!**
THANKS!",Please let us delete Followers!

each night I sit next to my bed and pray SSNP is life I said ,SSNP is love 
Bashar called me a faggot
I called him a cunt
he slaps me and sends me off to bed
I lay there crying when suddenly I feel a warm presense in my room 
it's Antun Saadeh 
I feel so happy, he lays a hand on my sholder and kindly says this is my Greater Syria
I know what to do
I spread my butt cheeks and lay face down on my bed
he penetrates me with the force of an Assyrian war ram
it hurts but I do it for Antun 
I press against his hard cock 
I want to please Antun
he lets out a mighty cry as he fills my butt with Syrian nationalism
Bashar rushes into my room
Antun looks him right in the eye and says 
""go take a baathism""

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Islam & current affairs in the Middle East most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Farfour's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - Farfour's personal philosophy draws heavily from Maliki literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike MEMRI TV truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the existential catchphrase ""By Allah, behave yourself. I will give you a taste of my shoe."" which itself is a cryptic reference to Islamic Golden Age epic, One Thousand And One Nights. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as MEMRI TV's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a shoe tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Assad smirked and obliged the pathetic virgin nerd. He was going to take his ass virginity. ""Oh yeth, Fothkbat. I'm really going to give it to you.""

Foxbat placed his hands outstretched onto the wall and eagerly awaited Assad's member. But it never came. He looked behind to see Assad's neck growing at and amazing rate.

""A-ass Daddy? What is going on?""

""PREPARE YOURTHELF FOR THE GREAT OFFENTHIVE!""

Foxbat screamed out in horror as Assad shifted into a different animal. One out of a nightmare. His head was like a miniature giraffe's and the rest was like that of a lion. Truly the lion of Syria.

With his mighty claws he held the poor shitposter down as he forced his head and neck into his body, completely annihilating Foxbat. He whipped out his phone and called his favorite man for this.

A week or two ago I ranted in one of the threads about Home Capital in relation to the decline of 50% in Equitable Bank just because it is in the same business as HCG. In fact, the HCG thing has been blown out of proportion in my view - sure they may have relayed news a little slow two years ago - and for that a company once worth almost $3 billion is on the verge of liquidation because of the dawdling Ontario Securities Commission and more so because of an American shorter named Cohodes. There's an old axiom the market runs on greed and fear and a couple of weeks ago (and maybe still now) fear clearly was in the air so I bought more EQB. In two weeks I've made 35%. I'm a buy and hold guy, not a trader so this kind of gain is both exciting and somewhat redeeming.

Fast forward to this morning when my largest holding (because of the exponential growth over the years) Badger Daylighting is releasing earnings. I read them before the market opens and am generally pleased - revenue is up strongly, EBITDA and EPS are just slightly higher because of higher costs but the company indicates those costs are under control. A lot of it was associated with hiring new staff as they are entering new markets all over the U.S. Outlook is generally positive and quarterly cash flow increased.

And the stock is down over 20% as I write this a couple of hours after the market opened.

Turns out Cohodes is rumoured to be shorting Badger which causes people to go berserk (that's the fear in the axiom I mentioned). Really, a 20% decline on a long-time profitable company with generally positive results? Just because some choad Cohodes might be shorting it? Fine, I'm implementing the same process - I've bought more BAD.

In a concept like free markets, people should be free to short, it would be hypocritical of me to say otherwise. But people (Canadians specifically) need to get over the instant fear that arises whenever there is a whiff that this guy may be involved. Sure there may be the stuff going on at HCG (although he alludes to it, he never specifically says) that Cohoes is aware of and certainly other companies like Valeant have had issues but there is no hint of anything wrong at BAD and people are foolish to react the way they do.

Rant over.",Fear of shorters is getting out of hand.

In a store I saw the Kobo display and really like everything about the Aura H2O but online reviews are brutal.  One malcontent here or there I can understand, but many people seem to go on extensively about the thing breaking with no warning or reason and to compound this, it seems Kobo customer service is bad.

Somewhere else today I came across a mention of the market as being zero sum - for every winner there is a loser.

This concept totally baffles me in respect to the markets as companies that I invest in grow (hopefully) and become worth more.  For example, if I bought BCE 5 years ago at $35 per share (which I did) and sell you the shares today at $54, which is what the market says they are worth, how are you losing?  Clearly I've made a gain, but how exactly have you lost?  You bought shares in a company that the market says is worth $54.  The market may be wrong and you have overpaid, but the market may have also underestimated the value of BCE and in two months the shares are worth $60, so you clearly haven't lost.  There is something to be said about the possibility that maybe the new share buyer isn't the loser - rather the customer that BCE has sold to at a profit is, but that goes against the entire concept of capitalism and doesn't really seem to justify a statement that *the market* is zero sum as the customer freely purchased BCE's product and may not even be aware of their place in the market. 

Maybe I'm missing something blatantly obvious, but I cannot see how the market is a zero sum game.",Question: Is the market a zero sum game?

What is also disconcerting is seeing the utter ineffectiveness of several agencies that are supposed to be in charge and the way they are covering their asses. 

[This article](http://www.lfpress.com/2014/11/05/several-agencies-were-monitoring-buillding) appeared on the Freeps webpage today.  In the very first line it calls the place an ""illegal group home"".  Actually, the chief bylaw enforcement officer just deemed the place an illegal group home a couple of days ago, **subsequent** to the fire with the sternly worded ultimatum to the buildings owners that they are going to have to use the building otherwise or apply for proper zoning.  I saw this in another online article I can't now readily find, I believe it was the CTV website.  The obvious question is why, if you visited the place ""dozens"" of times in the last year, wasn't it declared in contravention of zoning bylaws then?  The bullet points at the bottom state the building operator was given until February earlier this month but there are a couple of issues there - why give the operator several months to do this?  Is the place really an illegal group home or are you just piling on now?  Also, shouldn't the building owner be involved?  This raises the issue in Ontario of the awkward situation between owners and tenants and the fact tenants can engage in illegal behaviour but a landlord has to go through hoops to enforce rules.

Another question is if the operator of the ""group home"" is getting money directed to him from the residents, shouldn't the agency granting the benefits raise questions?  It's not like this was happening in secret, apparently this operator has several locations with dozens and dozens of residents.

Yet another: how freaking long is the fire department letting transgressions lapsing?  Any serious news organization (of which the Freeps is not) should be asking what exactly caused the fire?  Was it due to the violations found or was it just an accident?  If the former, who is going to accept responsibility for someones death? Since this was a multi unit building, the Electrical Safety Agency (ESA) should have been involved.  Were they?  The fire department is trying to look like they were on top of things by stating they were going there 5 times in 5 days, to me it just looks like ineffectiveness.

If the health unit was on site, what were the long term results of their inspections?  Were these individuals living in squalor?  Did they co-ordinate with any other agencies? 

This whole thing has exposed an embarrassing lack of co-ordination and effectiveness with organizations that are supposed to be on the ball and looking out for those less well off.  Tough questions need to be asked and better yet, they need to be answered.

However, the current race offers a startlingly poor choice of candidates with the front-runners being two underwhelming city councillor and a former one.  Matt Brown may be a good candidate, I don’t really know and that is exactly the problem - I don’t really know.  Even if you are a supporter of his you have to admit his stint on council has been rather… quiet.  Joe Swan on the other hand is quite outspoken, however his lack of achievement, especially outside of government gives pause for concern.  Roger Caranci is a middle-aged Italian Liberal - the last two of those haven’t worked out too well for London - but hasn’t really offered a reason why he is running other than the job is open.

The question is, where are the good candidates - people from outside the political spectrum but with leadership experience?  People with fresh ideas and a concern about turning London into everything it can be?  In addition, why are numerous current councillors deciding to not run again?  My belief is that the answer is the reason London is currently in the straits that it is - an entrenched bureaucracy that is growing increasingly difficult to deal with.

Government at any level is a difficult process - elected officials are the administrators that rely on employed staff to carry out the functions provided.  In recent years in London it has become quite clear that staff see themselves as working independent of the elected officials.  Observe the city manager doesn’t even live in the city.  Note the total disregard for budget allotments from various department heads such as the health unit and the police and fire departments.  The attitude seems to be that tax dollars are there for the taking and hey, might as well use that money to build an empire.  Despite massive public dislike for the project, the former police chief (who never saw a tax dollar he didn’t like) is spearheading the move for a performing arts centre - presumably his experience in building the addition to the police headquarters will serve him well.  The chief by-law enforcement officer is such a showboat that local graffiti artists took to tagging his name around the city.  City staff is unable to deal with relatively mundane issues for other cities such as food trucks.  The majority of lower level city employees are concerned about doing their job well and are a pleasure to deal with, but occasionally you run into difficult ones.  Anyone trying to raise the issue with their superior will see wagon-circling to a remarkable extent.

All of this (and many more examples) indicate to me that qualified candidates for mayor - and many council positions - are turned off by the idea of inheriting that type of mess.  Local media likes to report that London’s problems come from a dysfunctional council, but here’s a news flash - politicians have always not gotten along and never will.  No, the problem is something deeper than that and I think staff - particularly at the management level - are the issue. So what is the solution?  Well, getting rid of a staff member every time something goes wrong is difficult because of the potential for lawsuits and huge payouts.  There is no quick fix, but council may want to look at making senior staff positions fixed terms or providing provisions in the employment contracts to more easily enable turnover when it is required.  Another possibility would be reducing the power of the staff members but that would inevitably require more work for council.  Is the answer then full-time councillors?  Or more councillors?  Maybe a return of Board of Control (although several of the issues predate BoC’s departure)?   I don’t claim to have the answers.  The purpose of my post is to enable people to ask the right questions.","What is the real problem facing London, Ontario?"

I personally think my least favorite HP casting choice was Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. I LOVE Fiennes in other roles, but for some reason he never quite fit my personal vision of who Voldemort was, even though he does in fact fit most of Rowling's physical descriptions of him, and his acting isn't necessarily *bad* by any means.

I argued in the thread that I thought Fiennes portrayed Voldemort a little too cowardly/unlikeable. There's an argument to be made that Voldemort's character *is* in fact cowardly, which I do understand, but at the same time someone who managed to become one of the most powerful wizards in the world with a large following should at least have some level of panache or likability. But there was NOTHING likable about Voldemort in the movies. I thought the actor who played Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets was a good depiction of early Voldemort--confident, very handsome, with a bit of deceptive charm.


Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort is kind of a fool, sort of a letdown for me. It would have been more complex if there was something oddly appealing about Voldemort, kind of like Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds.

What do you think? Do you agree? If you disagree, why?

Penny for your thoughts :)

edit: I want to clarify that when I say ""likable"" I really mean ""impressive"" or ""effectively scary.""

Obviously, I was way too young to really grasp the content of this film, but I still found it very good and important, and I took away from it as much as a sheltered 14-year-old girl can take away from such a movie. I read the book around the same time and it remains one of my favorites of the 20th century.

I've watched the movie every few years since then, sometimes showing it to people and sometimes alone, and each time it touches me in a new way. However, some feelings about this film have always stayed with me despite what many others think about it. I certainly believe this film to be tragic on an unspeakable level, but I have never seen it as a hopeless movie the way some people do. Each time I finish it and the credits roll to nothing but the sound of seagulls, I don't feel empty. I feel spellbound and speechless, sure, but I don't feel hopeless.

I was thinking about this the other day while I was listening to the famous ""Cleaning Apartment"" score bit, and something really hit me about this movie and why I like watching it and don't consider it to be one of those movies in askreddit that people say they only watched once and never want to see again.

I think that the story of these characters is depicted in a way that screams out that their tragedies *matter* in the world, despite the characters being simultaneously depicted as losers who do not contribute to society at all. This perspective is what leaves me feeling sad yet still hopeful when this movie ends. All of the characters in the story are people whose lives don't really make much of an impact on the world, yet the book and movie insist that their stories are still tragic and that what happens to them is a terrible thing. Many other films that explore the bleakness of poverty and drug addiction cast the characters in an unsympathetic, apathetic, and dismissive way that generally criticizes their lifestyle and warns the viewer of what fate their actions have in store for them.

But the characters in Requiem are not depicted this way, despite their utterly mundane lives. Sara is a widow whose only joys in life come from sitting around with her aging lady friends or watching TV. Her son is a deadbeat heroin addict with deadbeat friends and a girlfriend whose potential is wasted a little more each day. These aren't people who fell from grace; they are people who would probably never go far in life. People that many of us scoff at in real life as being nothing more than a strain on society.

I know this movie doesn't offer any advice or consolation in the wake of its tragic end, but I DO believe that it is more than a cautionary tale. I think it is, well, a requiem. It's an elegy for people who have suffered from addiction and people who have been failed by institutions through the stigma of mental health awareness.

Maybe all this sounds like ""common knowledge"" about the film, but in my own experience many people who talk about this movie act like it is unbearably sad for the sake of being sad, or that it should only be watched once, almost for masochistic reasons.

I think it ultimately shows us that tragedy can be muted and appear in ways that are not always so obvious to the rest of the world. I think that's why the score is a masterpiece too, it insists over and over that what happens to these people is something worth mourning about, even if there are no heroes.

Last year's World Cup marks my first real interest in soccer, and I really like watching it now. I've really enjoyed following Real Madrid, particularly Ronaldo. So that's why I'm here.

I am so new to the sport, so I really don't know much about what is ""typical"" of games (between club teams or really any leagues in general) and I'm not at all qualified to make good observations about any patterns I might notice.

HOWEVER. Today watching the game against Villarreal, I did notice that Ronaldo seemed to not really do much except wait at the other end of the field for someone to give him the ball. Is this normal of someone in his position? Do they ever play defensively on a consistent basis? I saw someone in another thread mentioning that Messi has been better about this to much success.

Anyway, I love Ronaldo, but he really did seem like he had his own agenda, and that was simply to score. Maybe not even for the team, but for himself. I've seen him looking rather ridiculous trying to score a bicycle kick goal over the past few matches, and I can't help but feel like that kind of behavior is a bit unbecoming. I wonder what his relationship is really like with his teammates on and off the pitch? Please tell me if I'm seeing this the wrong way but something feels off about the notion of a striker basically standing around waiting to snatch up the glory when someone else gives him a beautiful pass.

I guess my question is, can someone break down the general formations/positions to me and explain what is expected of the players in those roles? Also, how do teams with star players typically feel about or deal with having someone on their team that is such a huge celebrity?

Thanks in advance and sorry for being such a newbie.",I'm a brand new soccer fan and have a question: Is it normal of strikers to stand there and wait for someone to pass them the ball the whole game?

During his bedridden period he is just so awful to her. I get it, she's pretty annoying, and he is a macho guy who struggles with being vulnerable. But she's his damn wife and it's so obvious she's just trying to be supportive.

Don't get me wrong, I like that Hank is so mean to her and I like that Marie doesn't stand up for herself—that is a far more realistic portrait of a marriage. Sometimes things are a bit ugly, and more often than not, couples struggle to communicate effectively.

Sometimes, though, his moments with her just seem so incredibly cruel, especially since it's obvious that her heart is in the right place and she is really nothing but supportive of Hank. Sure, his job is tough, but being his spouse must be difficult too. It would take a lot of strength of mind. I just wish Marie stood up for herself more.

Anyway, I just felt like getting that off my chest. I'm re-watching the series right now and even I feel the sting of Hank's utter grumpiness. It's so evident that his character cannot stand to be in a compromised position, and I understand that. But even in front of his own wife?

Not just because he dies, but the way that Walt treats him when they first start working together and the fact that he replaces him. I think part of it is because he wants Jesse on his side again in order to convince him not to press charges against Hank. However, Walt does seem legitimately bothered or annoyed by Gale. This is odd because he and Gale share the same respect for the ""magic"" of chemistry and they both eschew the frustrations of the academia. Walt is very moved by Gale's recitation of the Whitman poem. On paper, they should be best buds, even if Gale is a little dorky.


So really I just wanted to hear what you guys think Walt's decision to dismiss Gale reveals about his character. It seems that even though Walt is a genius with a true love/respect for chemistry, these sentiments are ultimately undermined by his ego. If he really loved the lab and the art of making meth, he would be thrilled to have Gale as a lab assistant over someone like Jesse. Instead,  Walt needs someone far inferior to himself to be around (like Jesse) so that his abilities can truly shine. He wants all the credit and all of the responsibility.


I guess these thoughts seem pretty obvious and nothing new, but not until this time around did it really make me feel so resentful of Walt. His dismissal of Gale is such a disappointing weak point in Walt's character.

People saw high fees, long confirmations and they did something about it. Now we have a stable blockchain with low fees and confirmations between 1-4 minutes. No one can deny that BCH is functionally superior to the legacy chain. Sure, you can always send a 10-30 cent fee but you'll be waiting 12-24 hours most of the time. Bitcoin Cash? 10 to 30 cent fee will get you through 1-4 minutes no problem. The only way Bitcoin works in personal commerce is by either waiting many hours to make purchases or spending obscene amounts of money to get it through. If a currency can only function as a store of value and is functionally useless or a extreme hassle to use for commerce, it simply cannot suffice as a currency.

It's not about how much your coin goes up in value every week folks. The real Bitcoin functions as a currency first and a speculative asset later. Bitcoin Core is only useful as a speculative asset and store of value.

Tacking on centralized layers such as the lightning network not only defeats the benefits of Bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned but also fails to acknowledge that the current BTC chain is flawed. You don't fix Bitcoin by removing the blockchain from the equation. Without the blockchain Bitcoin is no better than fiat. 

Don't buy BCH simply to ride a wave of speculation in value. Buy BCH because it's the real Bitcoin, and a functioning one at that. ",Bitcoin Cash is an evolution of Bitcoin. Fighting Bitcoin Cash and remaining ignorant is a futile attempt at impeding progress.

I rode it for the first time a few months ago and it was okay/pretty good; never rode it as a child for some reason. 

I just returned from another trip and again... wait times bounced between 60 and 90 minutes. The ride system is cool, the scenes are well done, it’s intriguing.

But it’s an old ride, Peter Pan itself is getting old too (lots of newer movie competition compared to when I was watching Disney cartoons 30 years ago), and it’s a notably short ride. I don’t think most consider it a Disney Classic like Haunted Mansion, Small World, or Pirates of the Caribbean, do they?

I ran into a Cast Member at—of all places—the bar at the Wizarding World of HP. He used to be a ride operator on PPF and said he couldn’t believe how popular it was for what you get (he had lots of bad things to say about the ride, not least of which was how short it is). 

Which is what got me thinking about that. Personally, I think he was a bit rough on the ride, but it raised a good point. 

This isn’t meant to be a hate fest on PPF. I’m genuinely curious. Why is this ride so popular? What am I missing?

And it lit a fire under me to write a post I've been playing with in my head for a while. Namely, the sort of best practice I've come up with for getting an accurate weigh-in. I'm down about 100 lb (up from my lowest; struggling successfully at least to maintain at this weight). 

So here goes:

* Be the lightest you can be when you weigh in
* Keep your weigh-in process consistent
* Try to weigh in often to dilute inevitable off-kilter weigh-ins

**First**, you want to be as light as possible when you weigh in. Doing so isn't for your ego; it's a way to tare out any abnormalities and rid yourself of innacurate ounces that might be associated with you when you weigh in. This is where the ""poop weighs a lot"" comment comes in. 

I suggest weighing in in the morning. (I'll get to that in a bit.) I also suggest: 

* If you generally use the restroom in the morning, do it before weighing in. Your internal waste does in fact weigh a lot. And it's not *part of you*; it's meant to be dispursed. (If you were to weigh yourself then use the restroom, you'd walk out a lighter person and that would represent an innacurate weigh in.) 
* If you shower daily in the morning, do it before weighing in. Sweat, dirt, grime, and other things you don't normally care to think about do in fact weigh a lot. I've noticed an inexplicable loss of almost 1 lb after showering sometimes for whatever reason. (If you have long hair, this plan may not suit you because your hair may retain enough moisture to *add* weight.) *Edit: A few comments have pointed out that you sweat in a hot shower. Good point, though I'm not sure I sweat a pound off, per se (my showers aren't that hot nor that long). That said, something to keep in mind because I actually wouldn't recommend weighing in after sweating because, well, sweat is part of you until you force it out. Your call.*
* Don't eat or drink anything before weighing in. A 16 oz bottle of water--you guessed it--weighs 1 lb. I'm still kind of ashamed of how long it took me to realize that things I put in my body aren't just calories, they also have mass. I generally don't drink after midnight the night before. (I'm also not a very thirsty person. Take this bullet as a suggestion only.)

You generally weigh least in the morning. Veritasium [made a good video](https://youtu.be/lL2e0rWvjKI) about how and why this is (including how much weight is lost just by breathing while sleeping for 8 hours).

I push for measuring your lowest weight because it is the most representative of *actual you*. Once your day starts, you've eaten things, drank things, excersized (which makes your weight inaccurately lower), and perhaps lost or gained inexplicable ounces here and there. When you wake up, you're basically in a lab where you can clean, clean out, and get an accurate weigh-in.

**Second**, keep your weigh-ins consistent. Consistent processes for how you weigh in keep your numbers more accurate and trust-worthy. If you weigh yourself in the nude once, stick with it. If you do it in underwear, make sure you stick with that underwear always. (You're really measuring the *change* in your weight, not the actual value of your weight, so weighing in wearing underwear one day, then nude the next will report out any weight change *plus* the weight of yesterday's underwear. Not an accurate weigh in.)

That doesn't mean you shouldn't weigh in if you've had a behavior change, though. (See next item.) But if your process remains consistent (especially sticking with the same scale when you can), it means your data is higher quality and more trustworthy.

**Third**, weigh yourself frequently. I do so every day. I know a lot of people will disagree with this and that's fine. But more data means higher-quality trends. It also means that any weird, out-of-left-field numbers are averaged away by the general trend of the rest of the numbers.

It took me a little while to get over the daily fluctuations that are very annoying (i.e., why do I weight 1.5 lb more today than yesterday when I stuck to my 1,300 Cal intake!?), but you just have to suck it up and remind yourself that you know what your intake was and that Cal ≠ lb. 50 Cal of celery has a much different mass than 50 Cal of brownie. Three bottles of water = 3 lb = 0 Cal.

The reason I initially started weighing myself everyday was because I joined Weight Watchers and our weigh-ins were on Saturday mornings. Well, some Friday nights I'd do nothing special, some had special events (e.g., a wedding), and some were legitimate drink-and-be-out-until-2-am events. 

When you drink, you lose major hydration, and hydration is weight. So many Saturdays I'd weigh in to find ""woo hoo, I'm down 4 pounds this week!"" No, I was down a pound, maybe, but I lost three pounds of hydration *just last night*. Those Saturday weigh-ins were inconsistent and very misleading. So I went to the weigh-ins, but kept my own data on MyFitnessPal so I knew where I *really* was.

**So that's basically it.** It's fair to disagree with any of these points, but I see it as an opportunity do a reset every morning, before the world hits you. Your data should be most accurate then and with a couple considerations, you can get the most out of the information you're tracking.

So, yes, poop does weigh a lot.",Re: Poop weights a lot (more thoughts on getting an accurate weigh-in)

It would be awesome if any of you could provide your thoughts or lessons learned on my situation.

My girlfriend and I are planning to do a few days in WDW either in October or December 2016. We want to take advantage of my parents' permanent address in Florida and purchase in-state APs. While they have a perm address in FL, they don't have Florida IDs; NY is still their ""home base"". 

We want to book our trip once the dining plan info comes out (so, soon). What's the timing on when we should get the APs? Do they last a year from when they're purchased/first used (e.g., 12 months starting on purchase or activation)? Or is it on a calendar basis (e.g., Jan-Dec)? (Hopefully the former.)

If it's based on when we purchase/start using the passes, can we purchase them *now* and have them be dormant until we activate them (or something) on our first day? Or do we have to purchase them as close to when we first use them as possible to get the most out of them and eat the time between purchase and first use?

And how long does the in-state application take and how long before we go should we do that? We're likely going to purchase the [weekday select or Silver pass](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/florida-residents/passholder-program/)

Lastly, any tips on what I need to do to get the in-state pricing? I think I need to have some proof of residence (electric bill or whatnot from the location). None of us have Florida IDs and won't anytime soon, for info.

Thanks in advance to my fellow Disney fans!

TL;DR: Trying to take advantage of parents' address in FL to get WDW APs. Need to know timing of when we purchase if we're going in the Oct or Dec timeframe. ",When should I get the annual pass?

It's specifically intended for the everyday SharePoint user and power user (e.g., site owner). Because many organizations do not allow custom code to be introduced (for security reasons) and do not have the resources to custom-develop applications or slick upgrades to the SharePoint environment, I plan to keep the content of the blog restricted to useful tidbits, guidance, how-to, best practices, and ""ah-ha!"" topics that can be done strictly out of the box.

No javascript, no jquery, no server-side solutions, no central admin toggles.  Just SP 2010, 2013, and SPO out-of-the-box. I've built some content already, but would be happy to team up with anyone that has great solutions they've worked on and would like to share their lessons learned and best practices with others, especially in the realm of collaboration, content management, taxonomy, knowledge management, web design, usability, adoption, etc.

This blog will be aimed at users and site owners, as well as SharePoint administrators who want to promote the tool but may not be the best at communicating the process to their users.

If you're interested, please PM me. I'd be interested in hearing about your experience, writing skills, and ability to commit time to blogging. At this point, the blog posts would be for bragging rights and gaining audience only. Though eventually I'd like to have a pay system in place for high-ranking authors.

I plan to use this as a work computer where I'll be building online content (web development, blog posts, graphic design, photo and video editing, mainly).

Purchased the late 2014 model (model available in-store in Nov 2015) and have installed Photoshop CC, Office 2016, SnagIt, and Screenflow. I upgraded to El Capitan immediately after purchasing.

I haven't gotten much into video editing yet, but I do a bunch of image manipulation and I'm really disappointed that the Mini is performing poorly when I'm running my usual apps: Safari, Chrome, iTunes, Photos, Photoshop, and iMessage. Hopping between apps is sometimes slow in response, Safari and Photoshop bring up the spinning ball all the time,

One would expect the computer to chug along with no problem under these circumstances. I did a quick iMovie edit yesterday and was *really* unimpressed with the response time of preview (especially random stops in the video and audio as it would process in real time). Not looking forward to doing screen recordings and video editing soon, which was the plan all along.

Specs on my machine are [here](http://imgur.com/a/8gAAs). Any suggestions? I live in the US Virgin Islands and purchased when I was on the mainland.

Mommy Fearest is currently in the jail infirmary. Anyone want to guess why? If you guessed ""bitch has managed to piss off every inmate around her and get her ass beat **again**"" then you win! Yes she has been beaten, yet again, by her fellow inmates for the crimes of being just soooooo unbearable to be around and pissing off everyone she comes in contact with. This time is a little different though. This time it wasn't because someone reminded her of me. No, this time she made friends with a few other guests and seemed to be getting along with them. Now if you remember I've said before that MF doesn't really make friends, she makes targets. Which is what she did. Again. I don't know all the details, only that she was overheard telling a guard that she had some good information about one of her ""friends"" and she would be willing to talk if it meant she got an easier sentence. Of course, the ""friend"" was told, and well.......lets just say that - especially in my state and in this jail - the saying ""snitches get stiches"" is very real and taken quite literally. So MF got what is commonly called a *blanket party*. 

Can I just say, I laughed until I cried when I found out. She is so damn stupid. Getting close to fellow inmates so that she can try to get a lighter sentence. I think that she thinks life is the way it is on television dramas. It isn't. Idiot. The guards seemed confused as to what info she could possibly even have on the woman she offered up, because (and I don't know details because privacy) whatever her crime was, it wasn't something terrible or unsolved. She had already plead guilty and been sentenced. I think MF was probably lying through her teeth. 

We have another weird situation with her as well. Without going into detail, because I've been told not to, it seems MF committed some pretty damn serious crimes in her quest to get to my state. At least one of which, the cops in that state have some very serious questions about. There is information that they really, really need from her and she is refusing to answer. *Now, the way I see it - and this doesn't surprise me because....crazy, but - she will give up fake info on a stranger to get a lighter punishment but she won't give up info on some things she did. Because it isn't going to give her a lighter sentence. It's going to get her a few decades more. Yet the cops from that state can't seem to understand why she won't talk. Are you friggin kidding me?* Anyway, she has now told the police that the only way she will give them the info they need is if they get me to visit her. Yeah.

So I was called by the cops from that state and asked if I would be willing. I talked to the lawyer my uncle's wife has so graciously hired for me and we're meeting on Thursday with the DA from here, and the DA from that state. He says they absolutely cannot force me to see her, but if she gives up the info she really is looking at a few decades more of prison. What she allegedly did is really bad and very serious. The problem is that they don't have enough evidence to make them comfortable enough to charge her, and one piece of info in particular would bring some relief and closure to an innocent family. So I don't know. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to wait on this meeting to get more information for myself so that I can untangle all the thoughts related to this in my head. For what it's worth, the legal people in my state are very against the idea of me going anywhere near her thanks to her little bag of fun, and the people I am dealing with in her state are not from the same county I was dealing with before. They're from a county a few hours away. They've never actually met or dealt with my mother before. Ugh. 

Now on to Jocasta Barbie. We had a little viewing party recently of the video and pics from the wedding. Remember how she was posing in the background of every picture? Well. Oh. My. Shit. I have found my favorite picture from that day. It's a beautiful picture of Bestie, his new wife (who looked drop dead gorgeous), her parents, and Bestie's dad and stepmother. In the background, is Jocasta Barbie. Hair a foot high, caked on layers of makeup including her siren red lipstick (which had been smeared by that point), one eye open and one eye half closed in that classic ""I'm super drunk"" look, posing with a potted plant. The plant was about 5 feet tall, remember that JB is very tall in flats and was wearing four inch heals so she is alot bigger than the plant. She really really looks like she was dry humping the plant! It is hysterical! We seriously cried, laughing so hard at this picture. On the video, the cameraman caught her falling as she was stumbling to the bar! Full on, face planting, heels over head, busting her ass. I am so glad he got it on tape! Bestie and his wife had pics made with his mom photoshopped out (she seriously got herself in the background of alot of them), and 2 albums made with her left in them. One for them to keep and laugh over, and one for me! I love them! I asked if I could post my favorite and they're considering and will let me know. 

They've gone NC with her. After they came back from their honeymoon, they sent her an official NC letter followed by a C&D. So, of course, she showed up at their place to plead her case. She didn't get very far. Police came and made her leave. She has been sending them letters, which they return unopened. She's blocked on all social media and both their phones. They have over a hundred emails from her so far that they are compiling. Then she got herself arrested.

Recently, it was Bestie's wife's birthday. So we all went out to see her fave local band play, then go to a karaoke place she loves. One of her friends posted a pic of us at said karaoke place on social media, and somehow Jocasta Barbie saw it and got the bright idea to show up. In true JB fashion, she wanted to make an entrance that couldn't be ignored. Instead of coming right over to us, she put her name up for a song. We didn't know she was even there until she got up and started singing, and I am serious here, ""Unbreak My Heart"" by Toni Braxton. She dedicated it to Bestie. Blaaaargh. Excuse me while I vomit. She came to our table and we were all a little drunk and in shock, honestly. She straddled Bestie while singing to him. It was so gross. This popped us out of our shock though and before I could even do anything - his wife (who is now my hero) grabbed the Mic out of her hand, pushed her off Bestie, and said ""someone call the cops now!"" In to the mic. JB tried to hit wife, but it was a wild swing and instead she hit her son. Another friend dragged JB back and away while Bestie and his wife went to go in the back. I stayed and helped the friend hold JB while we waited on the cops. She blasted me. Once again, I am a bull dyke and I ruined her relationship with her son and new daughter, I am just jealous of her relationship with her son (*yeah sure. Cause I dont have my own dysfunctional relationship with my own mother*), and I guess she heard what happened with my mom through the gossip network because she started saying that now she knows why my own mother hates me so much and she's glad my mom broke my nose and too bad she didn't get to do worse. Bestie heard this part, came flying out of nowhere (seriously, I didn't even see him until he was in front of her face) and just *let loose* on her. Screaming at her so loud he was spitting. I don't blame him. I'm pretty proud of him for not hitting her, to be honest. He told her she wasn't any different from my mother, and that she had no right to look down on anyone else since she was nothing but a lowlife who abandoned her own child and then tried to pretend she never left. How she was obsessed with him and it was disgusting and he wanted to puke every time she even touched him. The cops came and she was arrested. We gave our statements and she was taken away. Somehow, at some point, she slipped a birthday card on to the table. Remember how I said it was wife's birthday? Apparently, she thought it was her son's birthday because it was for him. It had this long, guilt ridden letter inside of it talking about when she gave birth to him. At the end of the letter, she wrote ""always remember, you were in my special place before you were ever in hers"". Seriously disgusting.

She was released the next day, but Bestie and his wife were granted a temporary restraining order against her, and have to go back to have it extended. Surprisingly, she hasn't contacted them at all since then. Bestie is in therapy, and has been for years, so he is coping really well. We've gotten together and had a bitching session about our crazy mothers. We found out that JB had also been harrassing his stepmother (who is an absolute angel of a woman. Seriously, this woman is amazing). She didn't want to say anything to him because she knew it would stress him out more, and he would be worried about her. Many of the things JB has sent to her have been accusing her of turning Bestie against his mom, and stealing both JB's husband and son. Which makes no sense as she didn't even start dating Bestie's dad until after JB pulled her disappearing act. But common sense is definitely lacking with these women.

So that's my update. I'll probably update again after my meeting with the DA's and my lawyer. As always, you guys are awesome! Thank you for helping me keep my sanity and keeping me laughing through everything. This place is the best.","An......interesting and familiar update to the Mommy Fearest saga, and a little Jacasta Barbie update too!"

Thanksgiving was great for my family, thankfully, with alot of laughing and making fun of MF and very little drama. We welcomed some new friends this year, as the family from my JMILITW post about the crazy granny who beat her grandchild for almost getting hit by a car, was invited and decided to come. I've become pretty good friends with them since that incident and was happy to bring them along. The DH's family lives out of state and DW cut off pretty much most of her family for defending her mother who is in jail and will be there for a while. My whole family fell in love with Chubbs, their little boy, and he had a ball with all the other kids. DW told me she had never experienced such a warm and loving family before and was overwhelmed by how much my family treated them as if they were part of us and so very welcome. It was really nice.

One of the benefits of all of us coming together is we all talk. I mentioned previously that my uncle's wife used to talk to MF, until we were able to show her how badly she was being manipulated and conned out of money. She is a sweet woman who we adore. Unfortunaltely she was involved in a bad accident about two weeks ago. She had been in the hospital until the day before thanksgiving, as they had operated on her twice. Once on the Thursday before the infamous baby party and another on this past Monday. News of the accident had been all over facebook, as everyone was wishing her a speedy recovery. On the day after her first surgery, while she was drugged up on the good stuff she received a call from another aunt telling her that she had lost the invitation with the address and time of the baby party and could she please have the info. I think you all see where this is going. MF must have been facebook stalking various members of my family and found out when the party was, but not where. She also found out that aunt had the accident and the surgery through there. So she called when she knew aunt would be doped to the gills with the strong stuff and pretended to be her sister (see the pattern? This is what she did when I was in the hospital) to get the info she needed. The reason she didn't show up until the end of the party is because aunt (in her haze) gave her the wrong times.

We found this out because, at thanksgiving, accident aunt apologized to the real aunt that MF had impersonated for giving her the wrong times, and said she tried to call her back to tell her the right times but didn't have her cell with the number in it. Real aunt had no idea what she was talking about. This led to the conversation where accident aunt told us how the bedside phone in her hospital room rang and she had this pleasant conversation with who she thought was real aunt. She was a little hazy on the details of the conversation, naturally, but said it felt a little weird when the person started to ask her alot of things about me. She genuinely believed it was real aunt, but didn't give her too many details about me because she knows I am a very private person. The woman on the phone hung up pretty quickly, but cordially, after accident aunt said ""Just ask her when you see her tomorrow"".

She now feels terrible. None of us are angry at her as it wasn't her fault and it definitely wasn't intentional. She even mentioned to uncle that his sister called when she saw him later that night. Uncle is understandably furious as MF used the painful and horrid position his wife was in to manipulate her into becoming a part of her plan. Even though she very nearly died just a few days before. Now, she feels terrible and like it was her fault that the party was ruined, cousin was hurt, and I was hurt. We all made it very clear that none of us think it was her fault. She was used, just another victim of the souless monster that is my mother. She will be writing an affidavit for the courts telling them what happened. She has even offered to hire a lawyer for me so that I am at the very least represented in case MF tries anything from jail. The lawyer I have is only in MF's state, so I am considering this. I feel really bad that she has been hurt by my mother, especially at such a hard and painful time for her. My heart breaks for her.

My new friend (the DW from the wild story) sat back and listened to the stories of MF, and saw first hand how hurt accident aunt was, and the ramifications that people like MF and her own mother bring down on those around them. She said it was almost freeing to be around so many people who understood. She loves my family, her little chubs loves my family, and they have officially been invited to every holiday here on out. My family adores them.

No updates on anything legal wise for now, but if anything happens you all know I'll be here bitching and ranting when it does. I do have to say that I am very relieved that I wasn't purposely betrayed by anyone. The thought of that possibilty really hurt and I'm glad it wasn't the case.",I have found the FM who gave Mommy Fearest the info....and it's not what I thought at all.

So last weekend was the baby celebration. We were on high alert, but didn't want to stress the soon to be new mom. It was a beautiful party and I love that they chose to include her husband in the celebration. Thankfully, the majority of the party was great. Good food, seeing people we love, and celebrating a beautiful person who is going to be a fantastic mother. About a half hour before the party was to end all hell broke loose.

We started to hear yelling coming from the hallway outside the hall we were in. Not wanting to upset the pregnant woman, myself, my cop cousin, and another cousin go to investigate. What we find is Mommy Fearest, with her brother (the STB mom's father) backed into a corner screaming at him to give her a kiss. A fucking kiss. She was full on trying to, it appeared at least to us, make out with him. Her brother. He was yelling at her to get out, get off him, and to stop.

We obviously pull her off of him and try to get her out. She gets free and runs into the hall. We follow and just as we come in she shoves mom to be down and starts screaming at her for allowing me to corrupt her and her baby, she doesn't deserve a baby, and I kill babies. I grab her because everyone was too shocked to move. It happened so fast. It is at that point she actually realizes who I am. It all went downhill from there. 

I watched it click. I watched her recognize me and it was like she changed in front of my eyes from regular crazy MF to holy shit I've never been this scared in my life MF. It was like my nightmares come true, and I cannot express how accurate that statement is.

She immediately started swinging at me, I tripped over my own feet (goddamn heels) and fell. She jumped on top of me and was just wildly swinging while screaming and spitting that I ruined everything. I ruined her life. I took everyone way from her. I am fucking her husband, the only father I have ever known. I am fucking the judge, the lawyers, the doctors, the police, just everyone. I don't know how I even have the time to attend parties with all the sex I have Apparantly been having. She was dragged off me, kicking and screaming, and ended up kicking me in the face. I get up to see if cousin is ok, see that she is crying, and just lose it. I held my hand over her (MF) mouth and start letting loose with everything. I even spoke about what she did to me when I was six, and I have only spoken about that once with a therapist. No one knew that she had done that, but I was screaming it all. Just a verbal waterfall of all the shit she has done to me, while I held her mouth shut. I did not hit her at all. Not even when she was on top of me. Why? Because it is much worse for her when the cops come, and because I didn't want my cousin to have an all out brawl at her celebration.

So this all happened. The cops come and my cop cousin tells them the situation and I show them the RO that I carried everywhere with me. My cousin and I were taken to the hospital to be looked at. My nose is broken, and I'm a bit bruised, but I am ok. Cousin is also ok. She stayed overnight for observation, as did I since they were afraid that between my heart condition and my seizure disorder the stress and pain would legitimately kill me. I was alright though. We got to share a room thanks to some awesome nurses and doctors. So we basically had a sleepover with occasional vitals and check ins. We talked into the night about some of the things I admitted since she had no idea how bad it really was. Many other family members have contacted me to make sure I was ok and to apologize for not knowing what she was doing to me my whole life. They knew she was bad, but not the extent of it. It's been an emotionally trying few months. To say the least.

So the cat is out of the bag with EVERY member of my extended family now. Fun times.

And now for the real fun. Mommy Fearest was arrested. She fought, she struggled, she hit a cop, she kicked a cop in the balls. She got her ass beat because she just would not stop fighting. At one point she was doing the windmill. She has been charged with sooooo many things. Just...sooooooo many. She threatened to kill me in creative ways several times. She threatened to kill my kids and make me watch them die. All of this while fighting the officers, and being hit with the baton and then dragged out. I have spoken with the prosecuting attorney and I am fairly certain that she will not be getting out anytime soon, and they will be taking what happened in her state into consideration when it comes to extradition. She will most likely serve her time here first, then be sent there to serve whatever shit time they give her until she either gets released or -who knows- walks the fuck out of the jail during lunch. Since it appears that is just as likely. She is looking at almost ten years right now after taking a bunch of stuff I am choosing not to include into evidence. Let's just say that the bag she had on her had a purpose and it wasn't a good one. If she wasn't so unhinged, she may have had an opportunity to use the items in her bag. Thank the deities for her insanity because she was planning on following through with her threats. I can't tell you how grateful I am for her lack of actual self control. A broken nose is nothing compared to what could have happened.

She is safely back behind bars. Behind bars that are far less likely to make the mistake of letting her go. This has been a really hard time for us. Paranoia, anger, fear, confusion, and uncertainty have been very hard on us. We got through it though. We are ok, we feel safer, and we are finally getting to relax. We can actually relax and enjoy thanksgiving.

Thank you all so much. This sub has kept me sane through this. You guys all rock!","Mommy Fearest has left the building...(an update, a scare, horrible stupidity, and a righteous serving of justice) Trigger warning: talk of my previous MF post about miscarriage. Part 2"

This is gonna be long so I'll break it up into two posts.

So. When last we talked, MF was awaiting her court date. Court date came. Judge sent her to a psyche facility for predetermined amount of time since the court ordered psychiatrist found her to be...ummmm....lacking in sanity and humanity. She was not declared insane or anything like that. Just that she needs some severe mental help. Seems unsatisfying but makes some sense so far. She was not allowed to be in the courtroom because of her epic meltdown when she was served with the divorce papers while waiting to be brought in. She attacked a guard. So she was restrained in another room. I sadly did not get to witness this meltdown and have very little details so far. Also keep in mind here that I am being very vague and fudging some details to maintain some anonymity, but this is all happening in my life right now so be nice.

So. MF is sent to a facility. Within two days, MF is gone. They let her leave for a few hours and she vanished. Now MF is on the loose, and no one knows where she is. EVERYONE GOES ON LOCKDOWN IN TWO STATES. Literally - my sdad and brother in her state, and everyone in my state.

Furious does not even begin to describe how fucking angry I am about this. Are you kidding me? Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me. So facility blames jail for not sending papers that say she is not to get recreation. Jail blames judge for not sending papers fast enough. Judge blames facility for allowing a new patient to leave at all. Around and around we go. A warrant is put out. No one feels safe. She is unhinged now that she lost her last victim. Sdad has filed for divorce. She has no one to torture on a day to day basis anymore. We know she is way past trying to be normal. She has lost all her marbles and they will never be found again. Scary doesn't even cover this feeling.

So. Schools are alerted, and given pictures of her. Store owners I have befriended are given pictures of her and promise to call me if they see her. Doctors info is locked down. A camera has already been installed in my hallway facing the whole hallway, including my door. Neighbor is warned because he has kids and I don't know that she wouldn't hurt them too. Cameras installed at almost everyone's houses. My precinct is on alert thanks to my cousin. We are talking full batten down the hatches, prepare for the oncoming storm, prepare for Armageddon type stuff. The problem of course, is that we don't know where she is. We don't know *just how unhinged she is*. We know what the court ordered psychiatrist had to say, what my own lawyers psychiatrist had to say, but they didn't evaluate after the divorce papers. I really believe that was last loss she was capable of handling. She has lost her siblings, her niblings, her kids, her grandkids, most of her friends, her own mother, and now her last victim - her husband. The one person she believed would never leave. She is now very high on hatred. I know sound dramatic, but this is how I feel.

Then, to add to everything, a family get together to celebrate an impending birth, and thanksgiving are coming. Both are at predetermined places, so we were hoping that this would help us not have her show up and ""surprise"" us. 

We were wrong. So very wrong.

She showed up at the baby celebration. In part two I'll go into that whole fun fuckery.

So. This is my update. Also, her flying monkey was sentenced and is incarcerated and will not be out for a while. I love my state.","Mommy Fearest has left the building...(an update, a scare, horrible stupidity, and a righteous serving of justice)"

I go to give him to the woman and she says ""come to grandma you bad boy"" and grabs him out of my arms. Then proceeds to pull down his pants and pull up and hit him in the butt about five times really hard. It echoed. When she went for the sixth hit I grabbed her hand and pushed her away. This poor little boy is screaming now. She is screaming assault. I pick up the boy and call 911. You do not hit a child with that kind of force, while calling him a demon child, and cursing at him. I take little boy over to the side of the restaurent as I'm on the phome telling the operator that I just had to physically a woman from beating a toddler. Old lady is screeching and my son is blocking her from getting me and the baby.

Police come, we tell the police what happened. By that point, the boy is calmed down but he had huge red welts on his little behind. You could tell it hurt him to sit down. Police get mom's number off grandma. We sit with boy, as he seemed more comfortable with us than the officers. 

Half hour later, a car comes into the lot and the little boy's face lit up when he his mom and dad. They come straight to him and are hugging and kissing him and apologizing. They get the full story from the officers and us. Dad is pissed off. He is practically breathing steam. Mom is crying and just looks...broken. Dad marches over to the patrol car housing his (as I found out) MIL and asks her what the fuck she thought she was doing not holding his hand near traffic, then beating him for her mistake? She is screeching about me hurting her. That's all she would say. 

I apologized to the boys mother for putting my hands on her mother, but she gave me a hug and thanked me for helping him. Dad comes over and asks mom if they're goimg to press charges *this time*. This. Time. This time? Ok, I'm not gonna ask, it's nome of my business, but dad looks done and asks as if this is finally enough for mom to understand her mother is terrible. Mom says yes, I give my full statement, as does my son. Mom and dad take my phone number and take their poor boy home. I told them to call me, I have experience in these areas and know people who can help them if they need it.

MIL gets taken in to be booked. That old bitch not only almost let that poor boy get hit by a car, she them beat him for her error. Not a good idea if I'm around. So we ended up just coming home and now I'm making brunch to burn off the excess adrenaline. I hope they call me.

So update wise, I don't have much right now. Sdad just went back to his state this morning. It was sad. He didn't want to go, we didn't want him to go, but he had to. Brother is ok and not too much damage to sdad's house. All stuff they can fix. An appointment is set up for Wednesday with the prosecutor, my lawyer, and myself. We want to get on the same page about whatever evidence there is that can help in my case, or that can help in theirs. I also have a court date here in my state the day before for FM. I am supposed to testify and so is my neighbor. She is claiming I invited her in and attacked her for no reason. I am clearly unhinged as I supposedly offered her tea then pulled a giant knife on her. I don't think she quite understands that the whole thing was caught on camera. My mother seems to prefer her monkeys of the stupid variety. Probably makes them easier to control and all that.

The week before last was my birthday. I am officially 41 now. Yay...I guess. I had a wonderful bday though! My son got me awesome presents that perfectly sum me up. Wonder Woman collectable, Deadpool t-shirt that says ""I speak Fluent Sarcasm"", Princess Leia t-shirt, and a nerf gun that is the perfect size for my hand. That boy knows me so well. It was made extra special since sdad was here to celebrate with me. I don't ask for anything on my birthday, just to spend it with the people I love, and this year my cup runneth over.

We got to talking about how MF ""celebrated"" my borthday growing up. Short answer - she didn't. Sometimes she used it as a weapon. Since I'm old and don't want to weite out 41 bdays, I'm going to bullet point some her finer moments.

* For my fifth bday, she convinced me she was throwing me a party with all my friends, then when the day came, laughed at how funny it was that I was so excited for a party that wasn't happening. When I cried she got mad and asked me why anyone would celebrate me.

* On my seventh bday, she gave me a pretty wrapped box. I was excited because she had never given me a gift before. It was shit. I assume dog shit. I didn't ask.

*On my fourteenth bday, like the exact day, I got my period for the first time. I was in terrible pain (eventually learned I have endometriosis) and she thought it was hysterical to wipe my used pad on my face and shove me outside, crying, to see all my friends who had come to wish me happy bday.

* On my sixteenth bday, we had just moved to a new state and I didn't know anyone. My sdad rented a limmo for the night to take me and some friends out around the new town. I invited the only person I had met, but MF uninvited her then paid some neighbor kids to come with me on the condition the make fun of me the whole time and spill their drinks on me. Happy sweet sixteen to me.

* After that, my birthdays were mostly ignored completely. Except for when I turned eighteen. I woke up to a card that said ""happy birthday - get out"". When I tried to pack my meager belongings so I could leave, she worked sdad up into a particularly brutal coke fuled rage and turned him on me. My boyfriend at the time had showed up to help me and had to pry sdad's fingers from around my neck as I was turning blue. Sdad fled the house and MF decided she should finish the job and tried to strangle me with a phone cord. She only stopped when bf told her he called the cops. He got me out of there and that was the last time I was in that house alone with them until several years later. To give you an idea of how bad it was - when I flew back to home state to my Nana a few days later, i weighed 83 lbs at 5'8"", the entire right side of my face was blue and purple and swollen from the beatings, the whote part of my right eye was completely red, I had several broken ribs and skull fractures, and I was speaking with a stutter from the brain injuries. My family did not recognize me. My uncle that picked me up at the airport walked right past me because he didn't know it was me.

After this, I hadn't spent any other birthdays around her until I stupidly moved back to her state with my son. By that time, sdad had gone to rehab and made ammends for the things he did. So my bdays were usually sdad making dinner for me, getting me a cake, and Mommy Fearest having a tantrum about the nerve I had making me people celebrate me. Usually she would have some sort of medical issue that required an ambulance and everyone's undevided attention. Sometimes it would be her calling 911 but not saying anything so the cops would show up to find out what was going on, and she would somehow have a story ready. Once it was that I stole her medication. Sdad went in her room and got it and brought it out asking why she thought that. It must have been a mistake, she says. Once it was that I assaulted her. Yet no one who was there would verify and told the cops it didn't happen. When she realized those things didn't work, she started getting in the car and disappearing. That didn't work because we were all relieved she was gone and no one went looking for her. Found out by accident she was actually just parked around the block waiting to see us go looking for her. We didn't.  Then I started just having sdad, brother, and some friends come celebrate at my house. That ended up with two broken windows, three flat tires on my car, and sugar in my gastank. That was two years worth of bdays. The first was the broken windows on my house and the second was my tires blown and the sugar. So I just stopped celebrating my birthday altogether. Until I moved to my current state.

She has yet to figure out a good way of ruining my birthday since I moved, thank god. 

So that is the long and sad history of my birthdays. It doesn't bother me anymore because I get to celebrate with the people who matter the most to me. My awesome kids always make me feel special, everyday, but especially on my birthday. This year, my special day ended with a three way light saber battle between my son, sdad, and myself. It. Was. Awesome!

As always, thank you to all of you who have made me feel less alone, made me laugh when I genuinely needed it, and have just been all around awesome in every way!

We were going to go back in front of the judge armed with even more evidence of her campaign of terror against me and mine. We were going to ask that her outgoing mail be monitored, and any visits be well supervised, since we have concrete proof that MF set up my assault and my children's harrassment during visits she had while in general population. The state prosecutor was in full agreement with what we were asking. My lawyer was very confident that, at the very least, we would get this.

As many of you know, Florida is currently getting ready to be hit hard by Hurricane Irma. The area where Mf, brother, and sdad are has been given an evacuation order. I don't know what that means for MF right now. She is in jail, and I don't know if they evacuate the jails as well. What I do know is that, as of last night, sdad is with us. Brother had to stay down there as he is in law enforcement and wouldn't leave for anything because he knows there will be people and animals that will need help. We flew sdad up yesterday, and I will sleep better knowing he is here and safe, but I am worried (of course) about my brother.

From what I understand, we were not able to have our court hearing yesterday, as our case is not considered time sensitive. For the most part, the only cases dealt with were time sensitive ones. I don't have all the information as to what that means yet, as my lawyer and his family have also had to evacuate, so we will be speaking sometime after next week. The good news is that the state prosecutor did talk to the judge about the letters and the flying monkey. The judge agreed that Mommy Fearest needs to be heavily monitored for me and my children's safety.

We don't know when we will go back for sentencing at this point. Everything is a bit up in the air as everyone down there prepares for the worst.

On the upside, my dad is here! My kids are absolutely thrilled to have their grandpa here staying with us! I took him to see ""It"" earlier today, and it was frickin' amazing. Seriously, the actor playing Pennywise nailed it so hard. We have not been able to stop talking about the movie! He and I were up long into the night talking about Mommy Fearest and I found out just how badly she has been obsessed with me. On the same day she was arrested this last time, sdad was looking for something in her closet, and found this cardboard box with ""(My birth name)'s Dirt"" written on it. He brings it out, opens it, and finds some of my old clothes, some Barbie dolls, letters to me that were pages long and rambled on and on about how I ruined her life, and hundreds of pictures of me that appear to have been taken without me knowing. This was before she was arrested, earlier in the day. She was at a doctor's appointment and sdad knew the police were coming but didn't know when. Sdad went through it all and he said it was really creepy. The Barbie dolls looked as if they'd been made to look like me, some seemed half burnt and melted a bit, some looked as if they'd been hacked at with something sharp, and some had things like ""bitch"" and ""cunt"" written on them in marker. He called them voodoo dolls. The letters were like tirades about how everything in her life started going bad the minute she found out she was pregnant with me. He said she had written in one that she knew deep down that (sdad's name) didn't truly love her and never would because she was saddled with satan's minion (me). She went into great detail about all the ways she tried to cause herself a miscarriage, but that she should have known it wouldn't work because it's not that easy to get rid of evil.

By far, he said the worst were the pictures. They appeared to span over years. All of them were taken from a distance, some in stores, some outside, some *through the windows of my old house*. Some were from Florida, and some were from my current state. He says he is not exaggerating when he says hundreds. He doesn't know if they were all taken by her or by others and given to her, but it made the hairs on his neck stand up. He decided to hide the box so that he could talk to my lawyer about what to do with it after she was arrested.

She got back from the appointment, and within 15 minutes the officers were at the door knocking. She saw the police car through the window and tried to get sdad to answer the door and say she wasn't there. He refused, saying that would get them both in trouble and it was better to just deal with the situation calmly. Her version of calmly is to try to slam the door in a cops face, then try to hit him with a plastic lawn chair. Sdad also says she pissed heself when she got tased. I don't know why that makes me laugh so much, but it does. He asked the officers what he should do about the box and they told him they would have the prosecutor contact him. So the box is apparently in evidence, but it's odd because this is the first I've heard of this. Sdad assumed I knew because the cops knew and the box was given to the county attorney, but I had no idea, and I don't think my lawyer did either as he never said anything about it to me. Can't get any answers about that right now, though, for obvious reasons.

So that is where we stand right now. More questions, no idea when I will be able to get answers, but at least she will be more heavily monitored now. Also, super happy that sdad is here is with us, and worried about brother, and everyone else down in Florida. I may not like that state all that much but I am sending out good vibes to everyone down there and hope no one gets hurt or worse.",A Mommy Fearest update - Is it possible that a destructive Force of Nature can rely on a hurricane to help her not face the music just yet?

I was able to go out last night, dance my heart out, even talk to strangers! Thanks to all of you, but especially u/madpiratebippy! Always ready with her awesomeness!

I want to clear up that flying monkey has been charged with forced entry, assault and battery, and attempted coercion of minors. I spoke to my law enforcement cousin last night who has been keeping an eye on that situation for me, and he updated me. She has bail, but it seems no one is willing to bail her out.

Stepdad says Mommy Fearest's letters are progressively crazier with each one, with the last one entertaining her ideas of how to get rid of me. They are violent, include torture, and the last one says she wants someone to sexually violate me. Funny. Coming from the woman has convinced herself I am pregnant. So it seems solitary really is breaking her. I do not feel bad at all. Court is on friday. I'll update after that fun experience. I reaaaaaly want to see her reaction to the divorce papers.

My brother has urged his colleagues to see if they can start an investigation into how MF was able to plan the FM assault from jail. He really is pissed off about it. He is also afraid she planned or is planning something else and he can't be here to protect us, although he acknowledges that I do a damn fine job of protecting us on my own.

I was able to truly let go and enjoy myself last night. More than I have in a very, very long time. Thanks to the support of all of you. I cannot thank you all enough. I can't say that I have ever felt more validated, supported, and good about myself and my decisions in my whole life, than I did after my last post. Seriously, you ALL rock! Every one of you!

So I guess this post is a bit of a clarification on FM, and update on MF losing her mind (hehe), and a great big thank you! I love this community more than any other, and I am so thankful to be a part of it. 

LOVE YOU ALL!",I want to give you guys a great big thank you! The crazy Mommy Fearest antics are easier with you all! Also - a small update

Lawyer conference calls, getting kids ready to go back to school, crazy wrangling at a wedding, and the big labor day weekend celebration that we are currently enjoying that includes costumes, parades, and lots of cooking. I've been non stop busy and I am so tired. I need a vacation.

Anyway, on to Mommy Fearest. She has had two psyche exams. One by a state appointed doctor, and one by a specialist my lawyer knows. Both exams came back with similar results. She is a narcissist, possibly with sociopathic tendencies, and is abnormally fixated on me. No...really? I never would have guessed that! I mean, she's been torturing me for almost 41 years, and is still, from solitary, doing it.

You see, her one flying monkey is apparently just as crazy as she is. She gave FM all the info she had one me. A phone number, a state, a neighborhood, my fucking social security number, and my date of birth (I am truly surprised she remembered it given she has never, even once, wished me a happy bday or done anything for me). FM, I guess, paid either one of those find a person sites, or a private detective. She found my address. My diagnosed psychotic mother now has my address. As does her FM. So you want to take one guess as to who showed up at my gaddamn door one morning at about 7 am? Mommy Fearest is in solitary, so it shouldn't be hard.

Flying. Fucking. Monkey.

I have never met this woman in my life. I answered my door half asleep after a half hour of her banging. I had layed in bed and hoped whoever it was would go away. Everyone I know knows to call first before coming over so I wasn't going to answer after I looked through the peephole and made sure it wasn't the police or fire department. She just lept banging. She wouldn't stop, this crazy woman who I assumed was a Jehovah's Witness. I answer, and I am immediately shoved in my door. She shoved me into my home, and followed me in. 

Now, I am not a violent person. She is incredibly lucky that I'm not being that I have a very sharp sword collection. I have about fifteen swords that are mostly decorative, but three of them are sharpened for home security. I am trained to use them. I am good with them. It is one of my favorite hobbies, that I participate in every weekend. I spend two hours training with the swords, and two hours on self defense. Sounds crazy, right? Many people think so. They didn't grow up with MF. They haven't almost been killed twice by their own mother (posts I am working on, but they are obviously hard to recount). I am overly enthusiastic about being capable of defending my family in case one of those situations arises again. It keeps me physically fit, too. I'm pretty damn fit and slim for a woman of almost 41 with three children. The point is...it is not a good idea to bust into my home like you belong there. Not at all.

I yell out ""code red"" so my kids know to lock themselves in their rooms. Well, room as my son goes into the girls room just in case. He is the last line of defense, in case I fail. So they batten down the hatches. This woman, about five feet four, well over three hundred pounds, with a tightly curled grey perm immediately starts yelling at me that Mommy Fearest sent her. Now I have no idea what she said after that. The last time I was almost killed started with words very similar to those. I go into survival mode. I grab the duel blade rod. Now this appears to only be a rod with talons on both ends, but is actually two short swords with talons on the ends. It's my favorite. I take one out and tell the woman to get out of my apartment before I am forced to defend to myself. I will call the cops, but I will defend my family first.

Know what this wacko does? She goes running towards the girls room screeching about their nana loves them and I am poisoning them. First of all, that creature is NOT Nana. She has done nothing to earn that name. Second of all, are you fucking kidding me? I am armed, I have told you to leave, and your response is to run further into my apartment? So I yell ""call now"" which signals my son to call 911 immediately. I grab this woman's arm and drag her towards the door. She is yelling, saying I am hurting her, all the BS these idiots spew. My adrenaline is at full go. I am ready to punch this woman. I don't. I continue dragging her to the door, where my neighbor is now in the hallway to see what's going on. I tell him to call 911 and he does. This, it seems, is what drove her over the edge. She began scratching me, trying to hit me, kicking me, but I won't let go. I am not going to give her another opportunity to get near my kids. She is like a tiny, wide wolverine. Growling, scratching, trying to bite. Finally, she does hit me. Right in the side of my head. I am a patient, and calm and peaceful person. I swear I am. I don't like causing others pain. My first instinct is to hit her back. I have a weapon, I could take her. 

Instead, I put the one sword back into the other, throw it into my apartment on the couch, and use what I have learned to restrain her. When the cops arrive, I am sitting on top of her, holding her hands together, while she is face down and screaming. She tried to tell them I assaulted her, she was coming to visit and see the kids. I have a full video system in my home. I show the cops the video, the neighbor tells them what he saw, the kids tell them what they heard. She gets arrested.

I don't know much right now about her charges or anything. However, she admitted Mommy Fearest sent her and told her exactly what to do. She was supposed to try and get the kids to listen to her and if she hurt me, all the better. As long as she got to the kids. Me being hurt was just a plus to them, as long as she could tell my kids that their ""Nana"" needed them right now, more than ever, and they need to tell the judge she is the best.

This. Fucking. Bitch.

My kids aren't testifying. They want nothing to do with you, you crazy bitch. They hate you, and it's your fault, not mine.

So lawyer meetings to discuss the psyche exams. The state one happened before psycho FM showed up at my house. The one my lawyer got happened after crazy FM, and the doc had all the details of the encounter. So many conference calls with people where she lives. Both psychiatrists spoke with me and my brother and stepdad. They've looked at her history. There is another charge against her for breaking the RO since FM has thrown her under the bus. Court date is set for her results and sentencing. She is, apparently, not handling solitary well. Good. Her little plan, formulated before solitary, has failed. I hope she breaks.

My brother came up to visit for a family reunion, that was awesome! He arrived the day after the crazy FM incident. He is pissed beyond all words. He works in law enforcement, and is pissed that she was able to plan this from jail. I've never seen him so mad. When he saw all my bruises and scratches from FM, he just got suuuuper quiet. We talked alot and both found out she has manipulated shit we didn't even realize. She tried to make him hate me. He said he could never hate me, because I was the only real mother he ever had. I cried at that, I admit.

Stepdad is infuriated as well. He keeps getting letters from her, but they're all hate filled manifestos about how evil I am. He gave those to the lawyer to pass on to the psych doctors. She will be served with the divorce papers, or rather, her public defender will be served with the divorce papers to give to her when he can. Most likely, at court for the sentencing. I will be there via skype again. I want to see her reaction to the divorce papers. FM is still in jail by me. It's been almost two weeks and I don't yet know whats going on with her case. Where I live is a metro area, so it can take a while.

So that's my update. I wish I could say this isn't real. I wish I could go one day without worrying about her doing something. But I know better. I think I'm ready to finally post about the first time she tried to kill me. I wish I had a normal life. One where I didn't feel the need to always be able to physically protect my family. One where I didn't keep weapons on display for actual use. Instead of just displaying my hobby. One where this woman is dead. 

One final note: Mommy Fearest has somehow comvinced herself I am pregnant. I am so very not. I mean, I am very single. I don't go out, or go anywhere where I would meet people. I'm afraid to. I am, quite literally, involuntarily celibate. Who wamts to date an almost 41 year old mess with three kids? No one. Yet, somehow, I am pregnant and she needs to save the baby from me since I am a baby killer. Those were FM's words. Probably parroted from MF. Ok. Sure. Whatever - crazypants.","Mommy Fearest - psyche exams, solitary confinement, and Flying Monkeys at my door! Yay."

One of the big things I had to do was play a vital role in my friends wedding. I commented about having to do this a few weeks ago, and promised I would post this story when it happened.

A little background: I've known friend for over thirty years. His bio mom abandoned him at a young age. He was raised by his father and his absolutely wonderful step mother, who is for all intents and purposes, his mother. Bio mom shows back up when he is a teenager, and wants to try to play mother of the year. She meddles in all his relationships, friendships, familial, and romantic. She is loud, obnoxious, an angry drunk, and just an all around shit person. Her and I have butted heads many times as I know from shit mothers and don't take ANY of her crap. I have been chosen to make sure she behaves at his wedding, thanks to my unique ability to shut her the fuck up.

So. Wedding time comes. I am escorting bio mom to the church. When I say I was her wrangler, I mean was stuck to her side the whole day. Alcohol helped. It helped alot. I am not usually a drinker, but with this women...well you will understand.

She was fine at the ceremony, except for some loud balling that I immediately shut down by saying ""will you shut up, i cant hear them. If you don't shut up, I'm dragging you out."" She shut up.

Then we get to the cocktail hour. Now I'm not proud of this, but i let her out of my sight accidentally. Actually, I went to use the restroom, and when I came back she was gone. For a half hour, I searched for this bitch. Then she shows up in a taxi, and gets out in a different dress. It wasn't white, at least, but it was one of those dresses more suited to a senior prom. Bright neon pink, so short her ass showed when she bent over, no underwear, tits about to pop out and poke someone in the damn eye. Just ridiculous. I caught her before she got all the way in, geabbed her and told her to go change. She refused. So I stopped the cab before he could leave, and dragged her, screaming her head off about assault and shoved her in. I got in with her to make sure she didn't come in something even more ridiculous. (Side note, being stuck in a car with this woman has to be one of the levels of hell.)

We get her changed back into her original, much more suitable dress and get back to the reception to find that we missed the entrance announcement of the bride and groom. This is, of course, all my fault. She. Would. Not. Shut. Up. About it.

So I told her that the mother/son semi dance her son promised at the end of the reception is optional and can and WILL be canceled. You see, she thought she was getting to do the mother/son dance. Hahaha. Not the woman who, you know, raised him as her own and treated him with dignity, respect, love, and kindness. This was a fight that went on for almost a year. He finally compromised and said they could do a short dance at the end of the reception. Then she was picking the most inappropriate, sexual, romantic partner type songs she could to dance to. He said no and picked some song I've never heard that isn't that at all. The threat of that dance not happening finally calmed her down.

Throughout the night, she would try to sit next to the groom every single time the bride got up. She tried to sneak into the pictures with him. There are going to be so many pics with her lurking in the background posing. I let it happen because bride and groom thought it was hysterical. I honestly cannot wait to see the pics.

But the big thing came when the toasts started. She was told that she would NOT be speaking. When stepmom was giving her beautiful toast, faster than i could catch her, bio mom ran and grabbed the mic out of step moms hands. She started giving a clearly rehearsed speach like she hadn't just hijacked the mic in front of 200 people. My time to shine. So I went up there, grabbed the mic in the middle of her little sanctimonious speach about how good he was a kid (she wasn't even there, remember) and said loud enough that the mic picked it up ""That's it. You had your chance to act like a normal person, and you blew it. You're done and you're leaving."" Friend (groom) is at my side, bio mom lunges for him and starts wailing about how mean I am, how I made her change her special dress that she bought just for him (ewwww, barf), and how he just can't let me treat her this way. She was on her knees, with her arms wrapped around is leg, just screaming like a lunatic. So me, and a few others had to physically pick her up and drag her out as she sceamed and cried (no tears though, imagine that) about her dance. She *needs* to stay for her dance. Nope. I told her if she didn't leave I would call the cops. She tried four times to run past us and back into the reception hall. The one time she made it in the door she yelled ""how could you marry that fucking bitch? How could you let this bitch manhandle me? Why wont you just come home with meeeeeeee?"" and she got dragged right back out. When I took my phone out and started dialing for the cops, she finally left with a promise to be back, in her special dress and get her baby and bring him home. She is crazy.

So the venue put someone on the doors to make sure she couldn't get back in, and the rest of night consisted of drama free fun for all.

Well. It has been an interesting morning here in ScaryKerry land! I asked, and was able to Skype my appearance instead of just a conference call, and I am so so so glad I did! I don't think I would have forgiven myself had I missed the show!

I got myself all set up at my desk for this. I even put on a nice shirt. I kept my pajama bottoms and Wonder Woman slippers on, but from the waist up I looked very put together and professional. I stated in my last post that my hair is now blue, MF has not seen me since going blue, so today was her first time seeing me like this. When the time came, I was connected, and got a full view from the right side of the court room. On the left, sitting at a table with her lawyer, sat MF dressed in a white and orange striped jumpsuit. She looked like an orange candy cane. Her hands were uncuffed, but she had her ankles shackled. She looked like shit. Stitches holding her bottom lip together, two black eyes, hair a mess. It took her a minute to realize that I was on the screen. I could tell the moment she realized it was me because her whole face changed. She went from this smug smile to glaring daggers at me. I could see my brother and Sdad sat behind my lawyer. She kept looking at them and giving these...weird sad eyes. Like her version of sad eyes. Which is just making a sad face but her eyes kind of blank. They ignored her.

The proccedings began and her charges were read to her. She seemed shocked that she was still being charged with the breaking and entering and the destruction of property. Then she really seemed shocked that they also charged her with attampting to steal my brother's guns. She made a noise and her mouth kept opening and closing like a fish until her lawyer whispered something to her, then the smug smile was back. Throughout the whole thing she stared at me with such malice it was laughable. The judge at one point even directed her to stop trying to intimidate me. That is how blatant she was about it.

But lets get to the good part. First, I was sworn in and asked to testify. I recounted what happened when she called the hospital, a letter from my attending physician was entered into evidence stating that my hear rate shot up, putting me into the beginning stages of cardiac arrest, along with a copy of the EKG I was attached to at that moment. I then spoke about the phone calls to my children, the recordings of which had also been entered into evidence. I spoke about the letter she sent to my cousin in an attempt to harass me through her. Also in evidence. She interrupted me repeatedly with noises of shock of disgust, called me a liar, and called me a master manipulator. Projection much? The judge and her own lawyer told her to stop every time. The judge threatened her with contempt, then threatened to have her removed during the testimony. She finally shut up. 

Then it was my brother's turn. I won the bet. His testimony is what sent her completely over the edge and devolved this whole thing into the shit show I knew it would be. He answered all of two questions and stated that it was absolutely her on the security video. That is when she stood up and started yelling at me that I turned her baby boy against her! How dare I twist his mind into lying like this!  I ruined him! The judge was yelling at her to shut up and sit down, the bailiffs were closing in on her, and her lawyer looked like he had just watched his career go up in flames. I don't know how she did it, in the confusion of everything I didn't even see her do it.

She slipped off her brown rubber sandal that inmates wear, and before the bailiffs could get to her, she sent it flying directly at my lawyer. He took a sandal to the head. I have to say I feel bad for him but I was laughing. She was tackled by two guards and cuffed, then plopped in her seat while the judge tried to get order back again. It was not a smart idea for them to cuff her hands in front of her. 

The judge got everything settled and all that anyone could hear was her heavy breathing. I swear her face was purple. As he was asking my lawyer if he was ok, she slipped off her other sandal. I saw it this time and I tried to bring attention to it, but before I could she was winding back to send it flying towards the judge. Her lawyer saw it, grabbed it out of her hands, and asked the judge to remove her. HER OWN LAWYER ASKED THE JUDGE TO REMOVE HER. She was removed and things went back to normal. Her lawyer asked that she be given a psych eval, because she ""clearly has impulse control issues"" and the judge agreed. He will decide her sentence after the results of the evaluation. Until then she is to stay in county lockup, in solitary, because apparently my doppelganger is not the only inmate she has pushed to the limit. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, her life has been threatened by several other inmates as well, and her lawyer requested it for her protection.

My brother's order of protection was granted. MF's lawyer was admonished by the judge for letting his client get so out of control. My lawyer requested that MF be fully shackled during the sentencing, for everyone's safety. The judge agreed. The judge also asked me, my brother, and my Sdad if she is always like this. Sdad said ""only when she doesn't get her way"". My brother called her a nutcase, and I told the judge that she is so much worse than this.

So that is what happened today. My sides hurt from laughing so much. My brother and my Sdad are going out to lunch to celebrate her being in there longer, and the added charges of assault on my lawyer and attempted assault on the judge. Also, solitary because she has managed to piss off her fellow inmates enough that they want to kill her. 

But my favorite thing, my absolute favorite line from today, was when MF was being dragged out of the court room. She turned her head towards me and yelled ""you'll be sorry, you fucking Smurf bitch! This is all your fault!"" Yup. All my fault 😂. Also I am a Smurf bitch. The judge asked her if that was a threat, and she said it was a promise, so now she can add her threat to her ever expanding file of reasons why the judge is going to put her away for a long time. She never even got to accuse me of putting a hit out on her. Oh well. I got my entertainment and everyone present in that room got a 'holy shit, you'll never believe what happened to me today' story.

I swear, if I hadn't witnessed it myself, and someone was just telling me second hand this story,  I wouldn't believe it. Who is stupid enough to threaten someone who has a permanent order of protection against them, infront of two lawyers and a judge? On the record. *In front of a judge*. She is the craziest of crazy bitches.","Mommy Fearest and the no good, terrible judge part 2 - Flying Shoes and Full on Insanity!"

Mommy Fearest is currently being treated in the jail infirmary because she decided to mess with the wrong women. I find this hysterical for one main reason: the woman she decided to target WHILE IN JAIL WITH SAID WOMAN became the target solely because she looks like me.

He got a call informing him of what happened a few hours ago. She'll be fine, just bruised and with a some stitches in her mouth. He said she had told him about this other inmate who reminds her of me and how much she disliked this woman because the woman had called her a crazy bitch and said she understood why her daughter hated her. So MF targeted her. I don't have all the details right now, but she pushed the woman too far, and got her ass beat for it.

Step dad spoke to MF while she was in the infirmary and she says I put a hit out on her. It definitely couldn't be that MF is insane and probably tried to terrorize this woman simply because she reminded MF of me. Nope. I somehow found an inmate who is in the same cell block as MF, who looks and acts like me, and paid that inmate to beat my mother's ass. That's the only logical conclusion here.

Her court date is tomorrow, and she wondered to my dad whether her appearance (bruised and stitched) would gain her sympathy with the judge. He told her probably not and if she knows what's good for her, she will keep her mouth shut and just accept her punishment. ""But he needs to hear my side of it!"" She said. So he told her to go right ahead and do what she felt she needed to do while in court. He's hoping she gets even more charges. So am I. I'll be at the session on speaker phone so I can hear everything, and my dad and brother will be there in person. This should be good. I'm pretty positive I'll have quite the update tomorrow. After all, she is the crazy purse thrower. She wont have a purse tomorrow thanks to being in shackles, so I'm sure the judge feels a bit more secure, lol.",A small Mommy Fearest update that has me crying from laughing so hard!

Come one, come all to see the shitshow that is Mommy Fearest as she stars in the role of a lifetime! The role of craziest bitch in her county's court! I promised to write this story next, and so here we are...the tale of MF and her fantastic flying purse!

At this time, I had been to court well past ten times trying to get a restraining order against MF. I had hours and hours of video and audio evidence of her insanity, as well as about ten pounds worth of printouts and copies of her texts, emails, and written letters to myself and my kids. Every single time we went to court, she would play the sweet, feeble grandma who just wants to be able to see her grandchildren and work on fixing the strained relationship with her daughter. I was just taking her actions and words the wrong way, you see, and trying to find malice where there was none. Her poor heart just couldn't handle losing us. The judge fell for it every. Single. Time. By this particular court date, she had called CPS on me for the thirteenth or so time. CPS had investigated every time and found all the allegations to be false. The last call she made proved to be her undoing.

I had been ready to give up fighting for the RO by this point because the judge never took me seriously. One day, a woman shows up at my door and introduces herself as a supervisor from CPS. I was mentally preparing for yet another interrogation about whatever accusations had been made about me, and after inviting her in and offering tea or coffee, pulled out my trusty boxes of evidence. Before I could even open them, she explains that she isn't here to investigate me. She is here to help me. I guess the local CPS office was sick and tired of wasting valuable time and manpower coming to investigate me every three weeks or so (an exxageration, but not by much) and had held a meeting after receiving yet another report about me. This time, I was allegedly feeding my young toddler aged daughters pot brownies to get them to go to sleep. I was also letting my elementary school aged son roam the neighborhood at all hours of the night. Supervisor speaks with all the different investigators who have spoken with us throughout the nine months since MF started calling them and asks for their assessment of me. These people, some of whom had seen us multiple times, had spoken with my son's school and daughter's day care every time and been told that I was an attentive mother. I volunteered at both the school and the daycare, so it wasn't like they didn't know me or had hardly ever seen me. Each entity had also told the investigators of their dealings with MF, because when she goes, she goes hard and no one escapes her insanity. Let's just say that both the school and the daycare had to go on lockdown because of her. More than once. Yet I still couldn't get the RO.

So supervisor decides that she wants to come meet me herself and get the whole story, first hand, and see if she can figure out how to resolve this issue. We talk for a while and I show her a small portion of what I had in the box labeled the Alpha notes. Those were the worst of the worst. The beta boxes were all the other stuff. I also show her the worst videos and play the worst audios for her. She was stunned when I pulled out the paperwork from every single time I went and tried to get the RO. She couldn't understand, like me, why it was continually turned down. She asked if I had shown the judge all my evidence, and I told her how I had submitted it all every single time with the added new stuff that would happen in between. She proposed that I try again, but this time, she wants to be there with me. She gave me the contact info of a good lawyer, and said she would let him know to expect a call from me. I couldnt afford it, but she got him to do it pro bono by showing him some of my evidence.

So we got the ball rolling and got another court date. MF laughed in my face a half hour after being served with the papers, and told me I was pathetic if I thought this time would be any different. I, myself, was not very optimistic about my chances even with CPS and a lawyer now going to bat for me. I knew how convincing she could be.

Court date arrives, our turn comes, and we go in front of the judge. Judge is ready to throw it out again, but my lawyer asks that he hear out the CPS supervisor who has come to help. Supervisor explains how MF has used her agency to repeatedly harass me, and lists off every accusation that she had made, as well as the results of each investigation. Then asks the judge if he had watched any of the video evidence, listened to any of the audio, and read any of the rest. He doesn't flat out say no, but he definitely didn't say yes. So we urge him to please review it all before he makes a decision. He tries to adjourn until after lunch but my lawyer points out the sheer amount of evidence and he decides to have us come back the next day.

That night, MF has herself a little victory party on my front lawn. Including a chair, a little Hitachi bbq that she used to burn the appearence papers that she was served, a bottle of Champaign, and confetti. I got it all on tape. Security cameras are a wonderful thing. She also brought along a radio that she blasted while she danced in celebration of yet another impending victory. I wish I was making this up. 

Well the next day comes and we all head back to court. I knew the second I saw the judge that he had watched, listened to, and read it all. His first words were to apologize to me for not taking me seriously before. When he addressed MF, who still looked smug even after hearing the apology, and started to list off the many ways she had broken the law, and had tortured my family, she started to crack. First, she said he misunderstood because he didn't have the context. Then it became it was all faked by me to make her look bad. Then just outright denial any of it was wrong. Not denial that she did it. Denial that it was wrong. He gave her a vicious tongue lashing. She kept trying to talk over him, which made him raise his voice, which made her raise her voice, and he threatened her with contempt if she didn't shut up. Then he granted me my restraining order. A permanent order, at that. He told her she should be glad she wasn't sitting in jail. Her reaction to me winning?

She stood, called him a jackass, accused him of sleeping with me, and threw her purse straight at his head. That poor judge got a face full of fake leather. He turned purple he was so angry and ordered that she be arrested for battery of a court official (don't remember the exact wording), and for contempt, and then called a recess presumably so he could calm down.

Watching her get tackled and handcuffed by the officers in the court room was glorious! She actually got tackled. I couldn't help but laugh my ass off when she went down. First onto the chair, then the floor. I don't even really remember what she was screaming but I know it was a bunch of ""you'll all be sorrys"" and ""I'm the good guy"" shit. I laughed so hard I couldn't breath. Between the euphoria of finally being validated in court, winning my RO, and watching her get tackled, I was uncontrollably giddy.

Mommy Fearest earned herself a nickname that day too. I won't write exactly what it is, but suffice it to say, she is known by that nickname to all the court staff and the cops. This is the same judge she was supposed to go in front of for her most recent violation, but her lawyer decided to put her court date off until he moved to another court. 

Her date is set now. She will be in court early next week. The new judge, from what I understand, is very close with the old one so I'm pretty sure he is prepared for the worst. I guess she has also figured out that if she goes ahead with her crazy pants plan, she wouldn't end up where she thought she would, so that plan is out the window. Now she is trying to get my step dad to pay for some high priced defense attorney. He isn't biting. She is stuck with her public defender. Step dad is going ahead with the divorce, yay! She doesn't know yet. She has one friend who visits her pretty regularly, and that friend has taken to passing messages to my step dad for MF since he no longer visits her. She simply cannot understand why he isn't visiting, so she sends her flying monkey friend to harass him. He is looking into finding a way to keep fm friend away legally.  

The best news is that step dad has decided to move to my state once everything is settled. I am so happy! He has been working on rebuilding relationships with his family members that he lost because of MF, and he knows that will be a lot easier once he moves back to our state. I am super psyched about it because now he and I can go back to having hours long discussions about the intricacies of our favorite author's novels.

This story takes place about two years after I had won the restraining order in court against Mommy Fearest. I'd moved to a different state than her, though she didn't know this until almost a year after I moved. Someone had an unfortunate and accidental slip of the tongue. Anyway, my uncle's birthday was coming up and it was his 50th! His kids and siblings wanted to give him a nice surprise party for it. So we all got to planning. We rented out a nice bar, got catered food from his favorite restaurant, and hired a local band he absolutely loved. Everything came together very nicely. Uncle's wife was still in MF's thrall and hadn't yet learned just how terrible of a person she was. She knew not to share any information about me or my kids, and respected that, but let it slip during a conversation on the phone that we were all planning a surprise party. Even gave her enough details for her to figure out the date, time, and place. This was a conversation she would come to greatly regret.

Shortly after this phone call, was when I had uncle and his wife over for dinner to explain MF to wife. MF had conned this woman out of thousands of dollars and several vacations. She'd even managed to con her into passing along letters of apology to me. Needless to say, these letters were not apologies. They were filled with vile, horrible things no one should ever say to another human being. At this dinner, I showed wife the last letter MF had sent to me through her. She was speechless. She cried and apologized and eventually thanked me for opening her eyes to just how much MF had manipulated her. So all was well. Or so we thought.

The night of the surprise party came, and we were all busy bees getting everything set up. Uncle shows up, everyone yells surprise, party starts, fun is being had. In the distance, though, a storm was coming. A storm that none of us were prepared for. Oh how naive we were, thinking we could celebrate something without Mommy Fearest to make it all the better.

An hour in to the festivities, the door opens, and I hear ""I'm heeeeeere! The party can really start now!"" When I say that my stomach dropped, this is not an exaggeration. It literally felt like my stomach fell into my feet. I froze. And then, I got really, really angry. It was like all these emotions I had been trying to deal with slowly in therapy came flooding in at once. Everyone stopped talking. I think the music may have stopped, but that could just be a trick of my memory. I felt everyone looking at me. I looked in the direction of the force disturbance, and there she stood. In all her sequined, shiny, demonic glory. She was in a red sequined dress. It looked like a ball gown. It had puffy sleeves and a big bow on the chest. A very shiny, sequined bow. It. Was. Hideous.

She came straight to me, and grabbed me in a huge bear hug, making a big show of saying hello to her victim...I mean daughter. I squirmed free, and asked her what the fuck she was doing? Loudly. I was angry. I caught my cousins eye, and he came over and stood next to me, and put his arm around my shoulders.

""It's my brother's birthday! I couldn't miss this! Come on, give me a hug, you know you missed me. Where are my babies?""

Now, I would like to say that I am not proud of what I did next. I would like to say that I was wrong and shouldn't have let my emotions get the better of me. But I can't say those things. They aren't true. I am content with my actions that night. I am not ashamed. I am proud.

I slapped her. Open handed, across her face, and hard. I couldn't find the right words to express everything going through my head, so I just went with what felt right. And, by god, did it feel right. I had never, in all my life, ever hit her. For all the times she beat me, had me beat by someone else, cornered me daring me to hit her so she could call the cops, and abused me to the point of nearly breaking my sanity, I had never once hit her. I am not a violent person. Yet, in that one moment, it just felt like exactly the thing to do.

She reeled a bit, held her hand on her face, and started yelling ""see? I told you all she was crazy! I told you all and no one listened to me! You see it now?"" No one answered. I think everyone was a bit shocked still by everything. I broke the silence and used the coldest, most seriously venomous tone I had to tell her to leave. That she wasn't invited, and she certainly wasn't welcome. She refused. That was it for me. I don't remember very clearly what I said but I'm paraphrasing from what my cousin told me I said. He said I sounded scary.

""You will leave. You will turn around, walk your ass back out that door, get back on whatever broom you used to get here, and you will never come back. You are in violation of a restraining order and I will call the cops and have them haul your ass to jail. But before you leave, whether on your own or with the cops, I want you to take one last good look at the people standing here. Look at their faces. That disgust you see isn't for me. It's for you. Your own family is looking at you with disgust in their eyes. Take a good long look at how people see you. They see the real you. The you that did terrible things to your own flesh and blood. So remember those looks. Every time you look in the mirror, remember how everyone is looking at you. Now get the fuck out of here. Last chance to leave before I call the cops.""

Well. She lost her shit. She looked at all the people standing there looking at her, then decided that she wasn't going to leave without a parting gift. Her whole face turned red, and she started screaming about what a terrible person I am, how I have turned everyone against her, how I have ruined her life, I have abused my kids by keeping them away from her (follow that logic, it's impossible, I promise), called me an alcoholic (I wasn't drinking, it didn't mix well with the medications I was on), and then followed that with this weird scream/bellow noise and started pulling her own hair. Two of my cousins, both cops (off duty) grabbed her wrists to make her stop and she screamed that I was to blame for all of this. So I slapped her again. She was hysterical and that's what youre supposed to do when someone is hysterical, right? Hey, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

The two cousins dragged her out and called the cops. Once she was out, I just collapsed. The emotional weight of the whole thing finally hit me. Cops came, took a report, and one of my cop cousins told them he would escort her to the airport himself to make sure she left the state. She never told the cops I hit her. As a matter of fact, cousins tell me that as soon as they dragged her out, her whole demeanor changed and she became cooperative. Even tried to have a conversation with them about their lives. She did tell them to watch out for me, though, that I was a junkie and would probably use them to get out of trouble with the law. Which is funny because when the responding officers showed up she acted like it was all a big misunderstanding and kept telling them that her nephews (who were standing right there) are officers too and they know she meant no harm. I think they just wanted to get rid of her so they talked to the responding officers and came to the agreement of escorting her to the airport.

I was inside, surrounded by family, being comforted. Cousin comes in and tells me the plan. I agreed because I just wanted her gone at that point. My remaining family members helped me feel better by mimicking the faces she made when I slapped her. We went on to have a fun, if a bit adrenaline filled, rest of the party. 

I was paranoid about her somehow finding a way to stay in my state and popping up somewhere. She didn't know where I lived, but still I think I was justified in being paranoid until my stepdad let me know she was back in her state.

My family, still to this day, has a running joke about not messing with me because of how (apparently) scary I sounded that night. I never raised my voice or anything like that, but I guess my calm angry voice is something to behold. I booked an emergency therapy session, because I thought I should feel bad about hitting her, but I just didn't. It felt good. My therapist said that she doesn't condone violence, but she completely understood why I did it. She also told me that I don't necessarily *have* to feel bad about it. After everything she had put me through, and all the long lasting damage she caused me, it was only normal for me to be overwhelmed by emotion in a situation like that. She also said, off the record, that she would have probably done the same, lol.

That night, MF showed everyone what she really was. Her mask cracked. She showed her ass to our whole family and group of friends. The last few family members, who still defended her sometimes at that point, stopped after that night. They finally had seen the real Mommy Fearest. She lost the last few bits of support she had in a matter of minutes.

I still think back to that night sometimes. It was cathartic for me in some ways. I confronted the big bad monster from my nightmares, and instead of running away, or allowing the monster to get the better of me, I held my ground. I faced it full on and found out that I am so much stronger than I thought I was. And damn did it feel good to get a little slappy with her.",Mommy Fearest and the time her daughter (me) broke her mask in front of witnesses

It is also one of the hardest memories to deal with. I debated for a few hours whether I should post it or not. I deleted it several times, and rewrote it, still not ever feeling like I could properly put the whole thing into the right words. After rewriting it for the twelfth time, I finally just decided to bite the bullet and hit submit.

When I say that the response I received from all of you wonderful people was overwhelming, I truly mean it. I couldn't respond to every comment because I was mostly crying for a while. With relief at having gotten it out, and with such a feeling of support and of validation like I have never known before. It really was an amazing feeling to know that there were so many kind, considerate, caring, and beautiful people on here that really reaffirmed my faith in humanity at a time when I was feeling at my lowest. I truly can not thank you all enough.

Mommy Fearest is no doubt an evil person. I am proud of myself for having survived her, I just forgot that I *should* be proud momentarily. You have all reminded me that I should be. After suffering several emotional blows these past two weeks regarding my physical health, and some setbacks that had me feeling like I just wasn't enough, getting one of the most traumatic experiences of my life out of my system took a huge weight off of me. I've been reminded of how lucky I am, and to be thankful for what I do have. Which is a wonderful little family, and frankly, my sanity. As there were many times throughout my life where I just didn't think my mind could take much more, but I've always pulled through, and I will continue to do so. Thanks in no small part to my kids and to this community.

As for MF, I have an appointment tomorrow for me and my cousin to meet with my lawyer and discuss 1) why this letter was not monitored, and was allowed to be sent and 2) how my cousin can protect her family from MF going forward. Cousin did not appreciate being used as a tool to hurt me. We have always been close, and MF picked the wrong person to mess with there. I was told Friday that apparently MF did attempt to write a letter to me, but I don't know where she was planning on sending it as she does not have my address. The jail intercepted that letter at some point early last week, and is sending a copy of it to my lawyer. I do not know what was in it, but I'm betting it's a doozy. My best guess right now is that they are monitoring her mail, but possibly only looking for key words and phrases and that is how the one to my cousin passed under the radar. I will be asking my lawyer to speak to the jail and to really make known the importance of reading her letters in the future. She has been known to try and hurt people I care about in the past in an effort to hurt me. I am not angry with anyone at the correctional facility, but they should be aware of her tactics so they can stop it on their end.

I spoke with my stepdad today, and he told me more about MF's plans for convincing everyone she is crazy so that she can be placed in a hospital instead of a prison. She has gotten it into her thick skull that she would be sent to a regular hospital, just placed in a psych ward. This is so very far from the way things actually work that I have to wonder if the inmates are fucking with her. She is convinced that if she acts insane, then her lawyer will have the judge put her in the closest hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Like any old hospital will just accept a possibly psychotic criminal to mix in with their regular non criminal patients. So step one of her plan is to start having ""panic attacks"". Step two is to talk crazy to everyone, especially her lawyer. I don't know what's after that because I was laughing so hard, that he started laughing too and we spent several minutes talking about how if she just acts like herself she should be golden. We will be calling my stepdad from the lawyers office tomorrow so he can explain what she is planning. I don't think he wants her to get out. He said this is the most peace and quiet he has had since her last stint in jail. 

MF is also convinced that my brother is going to drop the charges against her for breaking and entering and destroying his belongings. She told my stepdad that he needs to command my brother (his biological son) to visit his mother. Stepdad (hereby SD to help make it shorter) told her that my brother wants nothing to do with her, will not be coming to see her, and is disgusted with her. I guess she thinks ""he'll get over it"". No. No he won't. He is beyond done with her. We've been discussing him moving to my state. He is looking into the possibility of transferring here with his job. I think it will be good for him. He has approached SD about moving here with him. SD is getting up there in age and we have discussed having him come to live with one of us anyway. That leads to the biggest revelation. SD has an appointment this week with a divorce lawyer. This is the first time I have ever heard of him doing this. I am so happy he is though.

So that's my update for now. I'm sure I'll have more soon, and in the meantime I've been working on writing more of my experiences with Mommy Fearest.

Thank you guys, love you all!",An update on Mommy Fearest and a great big thank you!

I apologize in advance, the topic of this story is miscarriage.

As you all know, MF is still currently in jail. This, however, does not stop her from spreading misery and pain. Recently, my wonderful cousin announced that she is having a baby! Everyone is thrilled for her and her DH. They've been trying for while, and couldn't be happier. They are going to be awesome parents. Mommy Fearest heard about the announcement, I'm not sure how, but she heard. Yesterday my awesome cousin got a letter in the mail from the jail currently housing my mother. Without going into too much detail, lets just say that she made it clear that since cousin has chosen to side with me, she hopes cousin loses the baby. Apparently bringing a child into this world and choosing to have that child know me, means it would be better off dead...or some fucked up logic. I dont know. The letter was disgusting. I can say that. 

Reading this letter reminded me of something I had tried very hard to block out of my mind. When I was three, MF remarried. My stepfather was (and still is) a good man. I don't think he fully understood what he was getting into. They wanted a baby. After a bit, MF announces she is pregnant much to my delight. I was thrilled to have a baby sister or brother! I didnt live with MF full time, but I did live in the same building as her, just in my Nana's apartment. The only time I really lived with my mother was when she was punishing my Nana for not giving in to whatever she wanted. MF would take me to her apartment and tell me I wasn't to speak to Nana anymore, then she would make sure to treat me very badly in such a way that my Nana could see it so that she would give in to mom's demands in order to stop the abuse. It was not fun. There was a baby on the way, though! Little naive six year old me thought this would make everything better since everyone loves babies.

One day, I was back to living with MF because Nana wouldnt give her money. I had just gotten a beating for not eating all my lunch and so I was in my room crying. Suddenly, MF calls me into the bathroom where she had been for a bit since she finished whipping me with a belt. 


What I walked into, in that bathroom, was enough to give any adult nightmares. Forget about what it did to my little mind. There was blood everywhere. More than I had ever seen in my life. I remember thinking that it may have been my blood from where the belt hit me. I remember thinking I was about to get in even more trouble for getting blood everywhere. Then I realized that MF was sitting in the tub, and that is where most of the red came from. She was holding something, but I couldnt tell what. It was so small. She gave it to me, with this odd blank smile on her face, and told me to apologize to it.

If you've guessed what happened, then I imagine you are as horrified as I am at the thought of putting a six year old through that. Mommy Dearest had had a miscarriage. She handed me exactly what you think she handed me. I can't even bring myself to write it out to be honest. What followed was me standing there, in that bathroom, holding it, and being told that I was such a bad little girl that I killed my baby sibling. It was all my fault, because I made her beat me, and now I had to apologize to it, to her, and later to everyone else for killing my sibling. I fainted at some point. I know this because our sweet neighbor came over to see what the horrible noise was, and walked in to me standing there holding it and screaming uncontrollably while MF stared at me. When the neighbor tried to calm me down, I hit the floor hard enough to cut my head open.

The neighbor called emergency services and both myself and MF were brought into the hospital. I needed four stitches in my head, and was released shortly after to my Nana. I didn't speak for fifty two days. I was punishing myself for being so bad that I killed the baby. I didn't tell anyone what she did that day. Not until much, much later when I was in therapy. The ramifications of that day were far reaching. I became afraid of going near pregnant women for a long time. I was afraid to go near babies for a very long time too. I was convinced I would hurt them.

Years later, when I was trying to figure out why she had done the things she did to me, I asked her why she did that in particular. Her answer? ""At least it shut you up for a while.""

If you've stuck it out this far, thank you. I've been having an emotional week, and getting this story off my chest has helped. I've been wanting to write it out. I did. Several times. Then I would erase it, and start over again because I just don't have the proper words to fully express what that evil bitch did to me. This is one of the worst things she has ever done to me. I still have nightmares about it, to this day, 34 years later. Then reading what she wrote to my wonderful cousin...that if given the chance, I will make her lose the baby, just brought these feelings all back up. She is in jail partly for torturing me and my family, yet she still keeps going.

My cousin gave me the letter so that I could give it to my lawyer and see if it could get her in more trouble. At the very least, so that they know they need to monitor what she is sending out more thoroughly. I hear she is now saying that one of her fellow inmates told her that if she acts crazy, then the judge will send her to a psych hospital instead of sentencing her to more jail time. So I guess that is her current plan. I only know this because she told my stepdad when he went to visitation to see her and ask some questions about some financial things or something. He has already informed my lawyer about her plans. So she can try, but I doubt she will get the outcome she thinks she will.

This has been an emotionally draining post, and I genuinely apologize for the horrible topic. It feels good to get it out of my head though. I promise that my next post will not be as heavy as this one.",Mommy Fearest and how to talk to a six year old about a traumatic experience.

My heart isn't working properly anymore. They say stress could lead to cardiac arrest. But stress is all I have. What do I do? 

I'm trying so hard to stay calm, but being the only parent to two bickering teenage and almost teenage girls who fight constantly is...I just don't know. My sons birthday is Tuesday and I can't even get him anything. He deserves so damn much for putting up with everything and trying so hard to help me. And I can't do anything. 

There is just so much. So many things that are so heavy to carry around, and you are just making it worse. I'm scared. I'm so tired. I want peace so badly, but there is none to be found. There is always so damn much. Never one or two things at a time. Always an overwhelming amount of stress. I'm supposed to stay away from what my life has become so I can live? How? How do I survive this? I always thought I could survive anything, but this? I don't know anymore. 

My girls are so young to lose me. You don't know that I have breast cancer too. I can't tell you that because you would use it against me. Seizure disorder. Breast cancer. Heart disease. A daughter who is special needs and needs me. A daughter who is getting older and turning into someone I don't know. A son who deserves more than I can give. Three kids who deserve more than I can give. My love isn't enough, I don't think. I may be dying, and I don't know how to understand any of this. Why is everything so hard? Why didn't I ever get a break? Why don't I ever get a break?

When is it my time to be at peace? I feel so alone in this. No one to turn to. No one to comfort me. So, here I sit. Alone in my pain and anguish. Without a mom to tell me that I will be ok. I'm so scared.","Mom, things are hard and scary and I don't know how to deal"

Its been a crazy last week, what with so much testing and more blood being drawn than I thought I had available. Right now it is looking like I may have inherited a form of heart disease from my biological father's side of the family. I wouldn't know because I have very little info about him as you'll read shortly. 

Mommy Fearest is still in jail. My step dad refuses to bail her out, my brother is so beyond done with her because she got my number by breaking into his apartment while he was on an international vacation. She also left him a nice mess to come home to since she was angry that he wouldn't pay to take her with him on vacation overseas with his other friends his own age. None of whom brought their mommies. For obvious reasons. So she is now being charged with breaking and entering on top of violating the RO I have against her. I advised my brother, months ago, to get cameras for the inside of his apartment and his door because I saw this happening when he told me she expected him to purchase her tickets to go with him. So, he has a lovely video of MF not only breaking into his apartment, but trashing it as well. She still claims she didn't do it.

Apparently she also totally didn't try to hit the officer who went to talk to her after I reported her with a plastic lawn chair. That absolutely didn't happen. He tazed her for no reason guys. No reason!

So, in jail she sits, awaiting a chance to appear before a judge and tell them all about how she totally didn't do any of those things. She told my step dad to call me and ask me to put money in her commissary since its all my fault she is in there. I laughed, he laughed, we all laughed at that one.  On to the origin of Mommy Fearest:

(TW for mentions of rape and domestic abuse)

There are two stories about my conception and birth. One is that MF went on a date with an older man who then date raped her. She found out she was pregnant, and being from a catholic family, was forced to then marry her rapist. He proceeded to beat her ruthlessly throughout her pregnancy. He was trying to force a miscarriage. I was born, and her heart filled with love and mercy upon seeing her daughter and so she decided to keep me. *My hero. He continued to beat her until she heroically stood up to him and kicked him out. He left that day, after telling her he wanted nothing to do with me.

Pretty story, right? It's also complete bullshit.

She met my father, who had a good job with an airline and could fly her anywhere her heart desired for free. My extended family loved him, even though he was 11 years older than her. He was stable, funny, family oriented, and apparently crazy about MF. They get married after a year of dating. Three months after marrying, they are pregnant! The first granddaughter! All the grandchildren had been boys until I came along. When I was about 2 or 3 MF's first love came back from his deployment. Suddenly, she says my dad is beating her. She doesn't have any bruises or wounds, and he is sporting black eyes and busted lips on the regular. Then, one day she stabs him with knitting needles. Claims it was self defense. While he is in the hospital, she throws all his stuff in the hallway. He comes back to find a note telling she wants $$ for child support or he will be sorry. She proceeds to make it impossible for him to see me. When she finds out he is hiring a lawyer to fight for custody, she gets him fired. She destroys his life, so he leaves. After she threatens to kill me if he so much as comes near me.

She thought her true love would save her from her big bad husband. He didn't want anything to do with the drama she had wrapped herself in. Didn't want a woman with a kid either. So she drops me on my Nana. A saint of a woman if there ever was one. He still doesn't want her. Now she is a single mother, who has work for a living. That will not do.

I become the bane of her existence. I am the reason everything sucks. How can she hurt me the most to make sure I pay for screwing up her whole life? Well you guys already have the answer to that. It gets worse though. So much worse.

In going to try to go in chronological order, but to be honest, some of the stuff is really messed up and screwed with my memory. I will do my best though.",Mommy Fearest - an update and an origin story (trigger warning - rape/violence)

You guys made me laugh during a time when all I thought I could do was cry. Thank you all so much!

On to what my monster mom did to my kids while I was in the hospital and they were scared and unsure. I'm going to bullet point because it will male it shorter.

* First, she called my home and pretended to be my awesome aunt when my youngest (12) answered. Successfully got all the latest information about me being in the hospital, which one I was in, and somehow which schools my children attend.

* After calling the hospital and laying her version of a truth bomb on me, she then called my house again. My son answered, and she proceeded to tell him to pack all of his and his sister's clothes and important belongings. She said she spoke to the doctor and he said I'm dying and she will need to come get her babies. My son has witnessed almost nineteen years of her shit. He knew better. He let her say her piece and promptly hung up after he had enough recorded.

* She called my home a total of 27 times in two days I was in the hospital. Constantly spouting bullshit. Telling my kids I was either or dead, that they had already taken my body to be buried in potters field with all the other disgusting mistakes, that she will cleanse them of my filth, that the only reason they hate her is because of my lies, that she will dance on my grave while they watch, and pretty much just repetitive rants along those lines. Every single call was recorded. I've listened to them once, and honestly don't ever want to again.

* The day after I was hospitalized, a CPS worker accompanied by an officer showed up at both of my daughter's schools. My son has already graduated. They spoke to the staff, and my daughters, then went to my home and spoke to my son. They had received a report that I had locked them all in the house with no food, and no electricity, and gone on a multiple day bender. Obviously, they found that this was not true. The CPS worker came to the hospital to speak to me after making sure my kids were ok. The person who reported it also told them my children were 8, 9, and 14 years old. She told them she was my mother and she was scared because I was going to kill my children. Thankfully, the CPS worker could see this was all lies. She flagged my mothers name in the system and provided me with copies of the report to pass along to the police in my mothers county.

* The day I was released, about two hours before I got home, the cops showed up at my home again. This time they were following up on a report that someone could hear screaming over the phone when they called. Apparently, a family member called to talk to me and could hear my children being beaten and screaming in pain over the phone. That family didn't have the address but did have the phone number, which was traced to my home. Obviously, they saw everything was fine and my son explained what was going on as well as playing some of the recorded phone calls for them. They gave him a copy of their paperwork to provide for the police in my mothers county.

Now, yesterday my family and I went to an emergency therapy session with the therapist who has been working with our family for about three years. I also have an appointment scheduled for my youngest, who has ASHD and ODD, with her therapist to help her process everything. She feels a bit responsible for this because she thought she was talking to awesome aunt on the phone and wasn't. We have all assured her that none of this is her fault and the only bad person here is mommy fearest. The session we had yesterday helped a lot to alleviate her guilt. Thanks to a commenter's suggestion, we have put a family password in place. Only us and awesome aunt know the password.

I'm feeling better. I have tons of tests scheduled for this coming week, so I imagine that will be fun. We are staying with awesome aunt for a few days, so that we can relax and spend some down time with each other. Lets just say, she lives on the beach and her area is full of amazing people and tons of cool stuff for all of us.

I haven't heard from the police in my mothers area yet, but I don't expect to hear from them until tomorrow because they have to present all the evidence to a judge, and let the judge decide how to proceed. She is in jail. Her state has a public database and I know she was picked up yesterday. One of her charges was resisting arrest so I can't wait to hear the story of what happened. My step dad is my man on the inside. I'll explain in another post how this came to be, but I know he'll be contacting me soon to give me full details. That man is awesome and is a reformed enabler/flying monkey. 

Right now, I'm just confused. I'm scared because I always am when she pops back up to stir shit. I'm relieved because I know that at least she isn't going to show up in my state. I'm beyond fucking angry at what she put my kids through. I'm embarrassed that I had to explain to their schools staff what was happening. I'm worried about my health and what the tests are going to say. I'm proud of my kids for handling this as well as they have and being so brave and strong. Most of all, I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired of having to always watch my back, of always having to fight for some peace. Bit no matter how tired I get, I will ALWAYS stand up and protect my family. Especially from a woman who has made it her goal in life to destroy our happiness. I will not let her break us. I just wish she would realize that and give up.",Mommy Fearest and how to comfort your grandkids in their time of need

I've commented with many stories of my monster of a mother. She has been stalking me for nine years now, and before that, she did some truly horrible and what-the-fuck things. Including trying to kidnap my children, multiple breaking and enterings wherever I lived, blazing firecrackers at my door in the middle of the night so she could claim there was a drive by shooting and my kids should live with her for their own safety...and the list goes on and on and on. No joke, this woman is psychotic in the worst way. The abuse I suffered as a child was...creative and incredibly effective.

She has popped back up in my life once again. I need to vent/rant.

This crazy bitch has a habit of popping up when I am at my most vulnerable. It's like she can sense my weakness. So on Tuesday of this week I went in for my regular check up at my doctors office. I had been diagnosed with breast cancer last September, and after a few rounds of chemo and radiation, I am officially in remission! Yay, right? No. Not in my world, and not with my luck. Doctor gives me a standard EKG, just like every other time. Next thing I know I am surrounded by EMT's and being transferred to the emergency room having words like ""cardiac arrest"" and ""cardiac event"" thrown around over my head. Too say I was scared is an understatement.

In layman's terms, I was in the beginning stages of a heart attack. I was admitted and treated. The scariest part was that they kept the paddles by my bed the whole time. Just in case. So I called my son, who is turning 19 in two weeks, and explained the situation. He had to take care of my two daughters who are 12 and 13. He has to explain what was happening. So, as you can guess, my kids were scared and I was terrified. So who should call my home while I am hospitalized and my children are vulnerable?

If you guessed my psycho mother, you get a prize!

My youngest answered the phone, mommy fearest pretended to be one of my aunts, and my poor youngest daughter fell for it. She told my mommy fearest every thing. As I am laying in my hospital room, a nurse comes in with a phone and says its a concerned family member. Remember that I am on a heart monitor at this point. I take the phone, expecting my aunt, and the second I said hello I was bombarded with this screeching, howling, mewling noise that is hard to explain, but that I know too well.

""Why aren't you dead yet? I prayed and prayed that the cancer would kill you, but evil never dies does it? I beg and I pray to the good lord every night to strike you down, to send you to hell where you belong, but your evil is too strong. You need to die so I can save my babies from your evil, so I can take them into my arms and tell them to give their souls to god and save themselves from your disgusting ways. I'll cleanse them of your evil. They want to come live with me, they always did but you, you sick twisted disgusting rape baby, you turned them against me.""

Now I had not said one word during this tirade. To be honest, I thought that maybe I was hallucinating the whole thing at first. I kind of got tunnel vision, and wasn't aware of anything around me. I snapped to when a doctor kind of shoved me back down on to the bed, a nurse grabbed the phone, and another nurse gave me a little pill and told me to put it under my tongue and let it melt. I guess my heart rate shot right back up into cardiac arrest territory again thanks to mommy fearest. 

Fast forward a few hours. The staff has changed shifts. I guess my nurse forgot to tell the my new nurse that I was NOT to be given any phone calls without a password. So new nurse comes in and says my sister is on the phone. I don't have a sister. I knew immediately. So I took the phone and before she could start her howling and screeching tirade again I said ""you listen to me you vile piece of shit. I am recording this phone call and every call to my home is automatically recorded thanks to you. I have you on tape lying to my kids to get information. I have several witnesses in the hospital who all stated they would be willing to write an affidavit all about how you tried to give me heart attack. That's attempted murder you bitch (obviously not, but she doesn't know that). I have a permanent restraining order against you, or did you forget that? I will be calling the police, and you will be going back to jail, and I hope you fucking suffer whole you're there."" Now I got angry. I admit I was truly pissed off and I shouldn't have engaged her, but I wanted to. I wanted to so damn bad. She tried to interupt me, I just spoke over her. The last thing I said before I hung up was ""if you call my children again, I will get on a plane, show up at your house, and rip your throat out. Do you understand me? Stay the fuck away from my kids.""

Then I hung up. This is getting long, but I now know what she ended up doing to my kids while I was in the hospital and unable to protect them. If there's any interest, I will post it. Thanks for letting me vent. In going to start writing about the many many things she has done to me and my family. There's so much, I don't know where to start. Anyway, thanks for reading.

From as early as I can remember, my nmom has told me all about how I came to be born. See, she went on a date with my much older father and he raped her on that date. She became pregnant with me. Being the mid-seventies and coming from an Irish Catholic family, my Nana forced her to marry this monster. Throughout the whole three year marraige he beat on her incessantly. Tried to make her miscarry me. Tried to kill her. He was a raging alcoholic.

Except none of these things are true.

She's been telling me that since I was about three. As I got older, and lived with my Nana, I found out the truth. She met and instantly fell in love with him. Pressured him into marraige because he worked for an airline and she could fly anywhere for free (hence why she loved him). She became pregnant two months after marrying him and he was THRILLED! He doted on her and basically became her slave. After I was born, she became angry that he loved me ""more than her"" and started to tell people he was abusing her. No one believed her because there were no signs. Then she stabbed him with knitting needles. That's when he left. He tried to work out a schedule to see me, he gave her money for me constantly, but she kept making false accusations against him and eventually caused him to lose his job because he was going to hire a lawyer to fight for me. After she had so successfully destroyed his life, he left for good.

Then she resented me because I was the reason for all of this. In reality, she met up with her old high school boyfriend and wanted to start over with him. Without me. So she gave me to my Nana to raise. She still manipulated the family into giving her money constantly. She would use me as a weapon. If my Nana didn't do what she wanted, she would take me away and beat me, or neglect me, and make sure to let Nana know that this was happening. That way Nana would give in so she could have me back.

That's just the beginning of what she has done to me and my family. I may post more because this is cathartic. Thanks for reading.",I'm finally ready to post about my own Nmom

Her father has bipolar disorder as well as borderline personality disorder and adhd. I had to have my girl committed into a children's psychiatric ward after several incidents at school. One of which almost got a poor fifth grader arrested for no reason. I've had the department of children and families called on me a few times by the school because of the lies She told for attention, before the school counselor realized what was going on. After the school staff realized that she lies so much they began calling me every time she told them something questionable.

When she was hospitalized in the inpatient program they diagnosed her with oppositional defiance disorder, ADD and borderline personality disorder. This was apparently a very big thing for the doctors to diagnose her with BPD as usually they are reluctant to diagnose a child as young as her with it. I've done the research and do agree with the diagnosis. She is now doing weekly behavioral modification therapy and is on adderal. I do see a difference as she is better able to focus and she has calmed down enough to be able to think before she says and does things. Where before, she was EXTREMELY impulsive. Her father and I are divorced and he lives in a different state. Currently she has only supervised contact with him Because he chose to go off his meds before her and her sister went to see him over the summer and he put them through hell. 

I am working closely with her therapist and doctor and like I said I do see a difference in some areas. But she still will go to any length to get attention. Especially from me but anyone will do. I have two other children. Her sister is a year older than her and her half brother is seventeen. Its been so hard on us. She demands so much attention that her sister has become resentful and my son has just gotten so fed up with it that he loses himself in his computer or video games when he's home just so he doesn't have to deal with watching what goes on. We are all in therapy so these things are being addressed, but I'm just lost. I don't know how to tell when she is honestly sick or hurting from when she just wants attention. I'm afraid she will accuse my son of doing something to her because she has already accused a fifth grader of having sex with her. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells constantly just waiting for the next problem to arise. I'm tired and I'm scared and my heart breaks for my beautiful daughter because I know that she can not help most of what she does. She is so smart and funny and would give you her last piece of candy if you have none. 

I don't even know what I'm asking for here. Are there any other parents who are dealing with this or have dealt with it? I love her so much. She's my youngest and she can be so awesome. I love my other daughter and my son with all my heart and I can see how this is negatively effecting them. And I'm tired and confused and honestly lost here. I've been a single mother for most of there lives. I've been through hell and back during my lifetime and come out stronger for it. And yet I feel helpless for the first time because I just want her, all of us, to have happy healthy lives. I've always been able to fix what's wrong and this time I can't. Anyway, if you've read all this, thanks for letting me vent. And if you have any advice I would really appreciate it.",Does anyone here Have any advice on dealing with my young (10) daughter.

I haven't slept in days so please forgive any formatting errors. My daughter has had issues for a very long time. She lies constantly, to the point of having child services called on me.

Her erratic behaviour has negatively effected all of us and being a single mom, I am at my breaking point.

I don't want my daughter to feel like I am abandoning her. She is a beautiful, kind hearted, sweet and generous person sometimes. Other times she just does these crazy things like telling classmates she is having sex with a fifth grader or sneaking out of her classes and after school programs. She has not had sex. We know this for a fact. But she just tells these lies constantly then freaks out when she is caught lying. Throwing herself on them floor and crying and convincing herself that she didn't lie and what she said was the absolute truth. I am afraid she is going to accuse my son of something and he will get in trouble. I am afraid that my other daughter will be so negatively effected, more So than she already is. She is so scared people are going to think she is like her sister. 

My ex husband has been diagnosed with both borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. He is not a great dad and when they saw him this summer he did some very questionable things to them.

I am taking her tomorrow and I am so scared because I don't know.if I'm doing the right thing.

In that, Ayer managed to write very religious characters in a very believable way. I totally bought that these guys genuinely believed what they did, and it didn't feel like a caricature of a religious person, which I feel rarely happens in big budget films. Writers have to strike a really careful balance between making a character religious and making it just part of who they are rather than *all* that they are, and I think Ayer really succeeded at that in Fury. 

Bringing it back to Diablo and Suicide Squad. If Ayer can bring that same balance to this character, then I think we are in store for a few really good character bits from a character that is so minor.    ",Something very minor I'm looking forward to in Suicide Squad

Here's where my theory comes in: They wanted a 'grounded' and 'real' reason for why Doom would have an army of robots at his beck and call. So, what they do is rather than have him have built all of these because he's Doctor Goddamn Doom, they are going to have the doombots be essentially drones or unmanned rovers that they would send through [this thing](https://scifielements.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-27-at-2-37-47-pm.png) or something using the same technology.

Sam has said several times that consciousness only ""comes along for the ride"", and that our brain makes all our decisions for us before we become aware of it. This seems to imply that consciousness has no casual power, and that the universe should operate mechanically exactly the same if it did not contain conscious beings.

But how could a universe devoid of consciousness ever feature a conversation between Sam Harris and Robert Wright on the nature of consciousness? That dimension of thought should be inaccessible to its inhabitants, like the 4th dimension is visually inaccessible for us. No one would ever think to think about it because nobody would have subjective experience.

This also seems to run counter to Chalmers' idea that a conscious person would be indistinguishable from an exact physical replica of themselves that was not conscious (i.e. a p-zombie). For example, if a conscious human and its identical p-zombie were raised from birth in isolation, with no external exposure to the idea of consciousness, then it seems reasonable that the conscious human could independently discover and contemplate the idea of consciousness, while the p-zombie would be completely oblivious to it. A conscious person and its identical p-zombie, subject to the same physical laws, but with a different physical outcome: a contradiction.

Anyway, would it accurate to say that subjective experience itself has a causal effect, instead of just coming along for the ride? Does it invalid p-zombies?

The current ""color banners"" could just have a small logo of the rank they are next to it.

I think it will help people who queue on their own but enjoy teaming up with others as they can see who is a better/worse rank.

For example, if I queue and see a bronze guy on my team I might want to land near him to protect him or if I see a royalty guy I may want to land near him for protection.

Or if I see a full team of bronzes I know I've got to put my backpack on, similarly if I see a full team of royalties, I know I need to get my towel out.

It will also help with people being shot-callers as if people see a decent ranked guy making calls they may listen to him more.

And it won't look out of place as there is space above the kill counter where the logos could go, or it could be redesigned.

Well, if you want your bank account quickly verified, you have to give them your banking username and password AND security questions.

After all that, where it had previously said $1000 it now said $250.

I would like to at some point. But I just realized something today that I hadn't understood about myself for multiple years. I had wanted to be a doctor since my senior year of high school, telling everyone I was going to do it and they'd call me Doctor ____. Something struck me junior year of college that I didn't understand at all. I no longer was planning to go medical school and I changed my plan to getting a masters right after instead or working for a year then doing it. That fell through too. I've had my mom complain to me so many times saying how wonderful the military is and they'll pay all your medical school loans and ""how could you just give up your dream like that?.""
This morning I've realized how bitter I am. You can talk shit about me saying that I'm lazy and I don't want to put in the time for more school or that I'm entitled and I just need to accept how the world works. I really don't care, I just want to live my life. What I completely understand but hate is how impossible it is to get a living wage right out of college with a degree and $30,000 worth of loans. Like I was just in school for four years of my goddamn life to get a higher education and it's worth $13 an hour? How in the fuck is that reasonable. Why don't I want to go to medical school right out of college? It's not because I don't want to learn anymore. It's not because I'm tired of tests. It's because I'm fucking spiteful of this system we've created as a society. I get that employers want people even for entry level positions that have experience and I see a lot of people complaining about that. It just makes sense and it's more cost and time efficient. But there's a clear difference between ""you should go for a masters/doctorate because you'll make more money and be more satisfied because of your increased responsibilities"" and ""you need one of those degrees because you can't do anything with JUST your B.S."" If you're one of those people that can go get it right out of college, good for you, but I'm stubborn as shit and I won't have it. I want to make my own way with the effort that I've put into it already. I'm ready to work and I want to start a new chapter of my life.

As I actually work in IT, my job can be a little dull occasionally, when going somewhere to repair something, I usually bring one of my soldiers with me, to assist with my mission, enter their base of operations, establish a command point and work surveillance.    
  
Once I have done my job in hand, I will sneakily leave one of my little army men there, usually precariously hidden slightly out of sight. So far over 30 people have been left with the protection of one of my trusty brigade.    

Today I was alerted to the fact that one of my troops has went AWOL and potentially endangered one of my friends dogs. I received a text asking ""If I had left a little green army man"" toy at his house?""  
   
I surrendered immediately as I would not want one of my soldiers to be harmed in their mission, and I admitted ""I had left a little soldier there, yes"" and playfully added “What are your terms to ensure the safe release of my soldier?”  
  
5 minutes later I received another text saying that my friend had spent over 25 minutes this morning trying to remove it from his dogs throat because he had found my soldier and decided it would be a fantastic chew toy. Since Yorkshire Terriers are small dogs, he was horrified that I had potentially choked and killed his dog...

...you get the idea.

There are [4 people on the team](http://imgur.com/tasHgeq). We should be in battle (and clearly winning) or standing over vanquished foes.

Some things:

* Everyone should be superhero-ripped.
* Any kind of weapons (or none) are ok. 
* Any kind of background is ok. 
* The team's name is Delivery, but don't feel like you have to put that in if it doesn't fit.
* Bad guys (dead or dying) could be labelled things like ""Build Latency"" or ""Tech Debt"" or ""Slow Deploys"".  
* No fawning women. (Some of the examples I linked have women fawning over the male superhero -- none of that.)
* Really, just have fun.

I skipped dipping because I'm an idiot and almost right away I noticed my astrea snails disappearing.  

I thought it was my pistol shrimp, but he was in the tank problem free for almost a year at this point. 

So my tank began to crash, and crash hard. The fucking worm killed and dragged the dead snails deep under my rocks and I'd get random ammonia spikes followed by grumpy corals and insane phosphate explosions. This resulted in huge red slime and algea outbreaks.  Naturally I bumped water changes up to every 3 days, added more snails and an emerald crab. Nothing happened.  I've been running this biocube for almost 2 years problem free and in no time it just all went to shit. 

I added a DI unit to my RO kit, added a Rowaphos reactor, and this slowed the algea growth but I was still losing snails and pulling the hair algea out in massive heaps. 

Finally, after many failed attempts at catching the worm and  catching the eunice worm taking chunks out of my leather coral (because he killed all my snails) I decided to breakdown the tank and start new. 

Luckily I had enough cured live rock available and just swapped all the old nasty rocks for clean new ones. I also did an H2O2 dip of all the old rock to kill any algea. This also kept my favorite feather duster worm alive. 

No sighting of the eunice worm yet.  But he's hopefully dead in my old rock and if he squirms out anytime soon I'll take a pic. 

Here's an album of my tank crashing and the rebuild.

My kids recently killed all the fish off in my favorite freshwater tank and now I have decided to convert it into a FOWLR marine tank.  

The tank is a custom design with a rear chamber that contains three compartments. The chambers are about half an inch to small for the Reef Octopus skimmer that would be rated for my tank  (75 gallon display with 25 gallon in the back). 

If I put two nano Reef Octopus skimmers in each chamber, with each being rated for 50 gallons, would this be reasonable? 

I've read horror stories about external skimmers and HOB skimmers, are these mostly unfounded or would I be better off adding one rated for my tank size that is an external skimmer?",Two protein skimmers in lieu of 1?

Another hint that he was a goner was that the pistol shrimp no longer was living in the save hole. He moved to the front of the tank, and I was happy as that made him a lot more visible,  and now I see him all the time.  

A week ago I got my new goby, and this guys is always out and immediately paired with the pistol shrimp.  He would readily feed on frozen / reef flakes but the clowns and cleaner shrimp always got to them before the goby.  So that's why I picked up the sinking pellets.

Today I present to you a story of a coworker,  McHammy,  and his argument for Standard Fuel.  

Background: McHammy and I work for the same company and conduct audits of chemical plants all over Canada.  This means we both have to work with each other for about 7 days in a row,  and this translates into eating all our meals and socializing after work while we compile notes.  

Stats: McHammy - 60 y/o 5'11"" male close to 380 lbs (confirmed on an industrial scale in a random waregouse). Has a PhD in mechanical engineering with a focus on layers of protection analysis and integrated safety systems at chemical plants.  

Timbitkiller - 30 y/o 6'4"" male of 225 lb muscled glory (confirmed this morning after Sunday liftz bros). Gained 50 lbs fat first 3 years due to travel,  replaced 50 lbs with vacuum added 20 lbs of gainz.  Fell asleep four years and woke up with a BA in Chemical Engineering.  

Clients  - Well meaning, but neutral.  

Point of conflict - Food

One of the very first times McHammy and I met,  was in the beautiful city of Brandon, Manitoba.  We met in the hotel bar on a Sunday night,  and we had much in common and the beers were good.  Never one to give a shit about the size of my coworkers,  McHammy was by all means a cool dude. 

About 15 minutes before wrapping up,  we discussed breakfast plans.  I,  being a lover of the food at our Victoria Inn stomping grounds,  proposed breakfast at the hotel.  McHammy would have none of that ""they don't look clean here,  let's go to McDonalds.""

Whatever,  I like McDonalds coffee and I'll just have an Egg McMuffin.  

Breakfast was had,  and clients gave us lunch.  Soggy pizza and a ceasar salad smothered in creamy dressing.  Yuck,  I rarely eat lunch,  so I had a coffee and some water,  McHammy didn't have any either,  I assumed he didn't like the food as well.  

So we wrap up and head back to the hotel,  McHammy said the lunch looked dirty,  and I agreed assuming he meant gross.  It was gross,  I agreed.  McHammy decided to get some McDonalds drive thru, and I politely declined.  ""I just stick to Standard Fuel""

""Standard Fuel?"" I inquired?  

""Yes,  standard fuel.  After 35 years of eating while traveling I have learned that fast food,  mass produced in a central factory, is limited in human contact and is inherently cleaner then anything you'll get in a restaurant""

""WTF. You serious? ""

""Yes,  I have never gotten food poisoning,  a lot of our colleagues have,  and because I stick to standard fuel,  I don't get sick. ""

""But that food is disgusting ""

""No it's not. Every item on that menu is assembled in a factory under better conditions then any restaurant kitchen.  I know when I get McDonalds,  it's consistently good and hygienic,  it is the safest option while traveling.  At a factory,  there are strict cleaning schedules,  frequent sterilization turn arounds and all food is flash frozen before it is reheated and served.  At a restaurant there are many single points of contamination and are one of the most common facilities people get sick at.  Standard Fuel is a requirement for people like us who travel so much.""

""but you can barely walk up stairs,  and that food is no better then candy""

Today I have a story to share regarding a corporate weight loss challenge that has really rustled my jimmies. Yesterday,  I recieved an email congratulating a group of 6 morbidly obese office workers, on comming in first place of our corporate fitness challenge.  

Now,  a little backstory on this fitness challenge.  About 3 years ago,  our company became involved in providing extensive new health benefits. These include credits that can be used for gym memberships or home equipment, free weekly consultation with Mayo clinic healthcare workers,  and a huge emphasis on employee health.  I really like it, and just to be honest with you cis-gendered shit lords, it has helped some people get into shape.  

So,  the corporate challenge is a fairly big aspect of this initiative,  and it's actually really fun.  You join a team,  and you add your goals, eg. Weight loss,  kms biked,  etc.  You can choose fun names for your teams and there are daily/weekly goals that are pretty fun. 

We are all given 2 fancy pedometers,  and are asked to track our daily steps,  how man kms we biked/swam, and how many hours we exercised.  This is all self reporting,  and relies on employee honesty and fair reporting.  Unfortunately,  no nutrition information is required, although many of us feel it would greatly improve the event and lead to better results.  

Now here is where the fat logic comes in.  The winning team consists of 6 of some of the most obese people in our office.  They some how self reported an average of more then 6 hours of exercise a day,  but had a daily step average of less then 4,000. The formula that averages the self reported inputs heavily favors exercise,  so their 6 hours a day pushed their team right into the lead spot,  ahead of a group of workers who are freaking marathon runners.  

So,  here is what they considered exercise.  

- Walk to your car,  that's 15 minutes

- Stomp your feet while sitting your desk,  that's like 2 hours of exercise.  

- Grocery store, that's an hour workout because walking I guess.  

- standing during a standing room only meeting, that's an hour.  


Their fucking exercise log reads like a list of shit that is barely considered effort.  They just fatlogic'd the shit out of the challenge and no one is calling then on their horseshit,  outside of closed company.  

Because we are a Global company,  they each will recieve a plaque,  and get $1,000 in gift certificates at a local outdoor store (Sail,  or Bass Pro). The funniest part of it all though,  is in the cangrats email,  there was a photo of them all holding the corporate challenge T-shirts.  Not one of them fit into the XL (largest size we had) so they just held them up.  Good job!",A group of 6 morbidly obese office workers won our corporate fitness challenge using fat logic.

I'm currently employed in a job that takes me to the one horse towns across Canada where the local population is less then 5k and maybe the hotel has a gym, which usually consists of shitty cardio equipment and machines.  

I am currently traveling about 2 weeks a month, leaving Sunday and returning Friday during my busy periods (mid spring and fall/winter). 

I was fortunate in that I've been home since early December and started the starting stregth 3x5 program after buying a home gym setup (rack, barbell, etc.) and had a personal trainer help me with my form. I've made awesome gains and am still progressing and have moved to 5x5 in the last few weeks. 

Now that spring is coming,  my travel will return and I'm afraid of losing progress.  As I'm only home 1.5 days before I have to leave again, would squeezing in 1 day of weight lifting, plus using insanity/p 90 while in the hotel be enough? 

I usually don't know where I am heading in advance and usually these towns don't have local gyms I can get a day pass at. So what can I do in my hotel room so I don't lose to much of my gains?

First time posting in this subreddit, love your guys tanks, love your advice, been reading like mad. I'm a former fish lover turned snake lover and wanting to get back into the aquatic hobby. 

So I found myself in a toronto Big Als fish store today, and ended up buying a 65 gallon fluval edge (while the wife wasn't looking). 

So I have about a decade of previous fish handling experience,  before the days of the internet, and there is so much more info now and im getting overwhelmed.  So basically I want an african cichlid tank,  and may just go straight lake malawi. 

As far as rockscape, I will be collecting and cleaning local river rocks (live on the banks of the credit river, and may steal some lake ontario rocks.) I plan on UV sterlyizing them as well as H2O2 cleaning and will do a fishless cycle.  

What I want to know from you guys is the following.

1) whats your consensus on overstocking cichlid tanks to reduce agression. Yay or nay?

2) Substrate,  crushed coral for PH buffering, or what do you suggest?

3) Is it worth buying a wave simulator power head system, or can I just get a normal power head for the clockwise current. 

4) Should I paint my background or just put up a dark film, or do a 3D?

5) My tank will be visible on each side  as it will be on a wall between my living room and dining room. Do you guys think a 'mountain' in the middle with open waters on each side could give a great view of this tank from each room? What other aquascaping options should I consider.


Any other suggestions for a ciclid tank are appreciated.  I will be recieving the tank in the next few days and will aquascape over the next week or so. 

Also, if anyone has convincing arguements so i can convince my wife to let me set up a salt water fish only tank (which she would have to maintain as I travel for work) please let me have them. If this tank works out, my next one will be a marine tank. My wife just doesn't want to top up the tank daily as she already deals with our dozen or so snakes.",Picked up a fluval edge 65 gallon tank. Cichlid time.

TSR unanimously agrees that pressing OK does not affect catch rates at all, but quite a few players do for various reasons not believe this.

The premise of the whole not-pressing-OK thing is that when you press OK, the game supposedly tells the server that the Pokémon was caught, and that this causes the server to lower catch rates for others. So naturally, there will have to be network traffic happening in order for this communication to occur. I have an app om my phone called [Internet Speed Monitor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andcreate.app.internetspeedmonitor). It registers network traffic and updates the displayed data rate every second according to how much data my phone uses at any given time. It shows as an overlay on the screen.

I recorded a raid against Weezing 11 days ago where I happened to have this app running through the entire raid and catching sequence. So I uploaded the relevant parts here in an effort to prove that this theory makes no sense whatsoever:

https://youtu.be/SRhGlC_4QiU

The speed monitor is in the top right corner. Note how the usage peaks at around 60 kbps every time I throw a berry and every time a ball hits the Weezing or is deflected by the Weezing. This indicates that Pokémon GO communicates with the server every throw (ball and berry). When the thing is finally caught I press OK immediately. Note how there is *no network traffic at all* when I do this. This proves that the game is not communicating with the server when pressing OK because communication cannot have taken place when there is no record of any traffic occurring on the network.

There are some small intermittent peaks of low data usage throughout the video that originates from other running apps. This explains the peaks of mostly up to ~4 kbps that happen intermittently. These occur because Internet Speed Monitor records data usage from the entire system and not just Pokémon GO, and stems from other apps using data in the background. But even with background data taken into account, there's nothing happening around the time I pressed the OK button.

**This proof is very easy to replicate.** The speed monitor app is free, has good reviews, and does not require root. So simply install it for yourself and do a raid with it active.

Hopefully this can help end the debate once and for all.",Video proof with easy replication: Server communication is not taking place when pressing OK on raid boss catch screen

While my other IAs were relatively poor and received mixed marks, my physics IA received a score of 20, so I thought it might be of some help to current physics students to see what I did, to maximize your own chances of getting high marks.

First of all, [here's my paper.](https://varden.info/doc.php?id=6) I'll be referring to it at various points below. Secondly, a warning. This is a wall of text. And it's a long one. I can't easily TL;DR it because there are a lot of things to consider.

## Getting started

**The first part is choosing a topic.** You don't have to, and you shouldn't, try and advance humanity's progress in physics. You're a high school student, and the IB knows that. You need to remember that you're not writing a PhD dissertation, you're just trying to experiment with high school level physics, to explain a phenomenon that you've observed or something like that. And there are several ways to come up with a topic at that level.

The most important thing when coming up with a topic is doing a topic that motivates you. So look for something that you're actually curious about.

- Is there a real life situation that you can connect to? If so, that's great! Try and think about things you've read about, seen, experienced, heard of, etc. that you're actually curious about. For me, inspiration came from reading [this xkcd what if? article](https://what-if.xkcd.com/71/) by Randall Munroe. xkcd what if?
 has a lot of crazy physics ideas that could potentially be used for a physics IA, but you should still ask your IA supervisor if the topic you choose is viable - it must be a serious and down to earth idea, after all, and actually *doable* at your level of understanding of physics. The main point, anyway, is that it's a lot easier to write about something you're actually interested in. In particular, it'll help you expand on your topic and explain why things in your procedure did or didn't work.

- Look through the syllabus and see if there are any particular topics that interest you. Are you a fan of kinematics? What about thermal physics? Pick your favorites and then look for a research topic that is viable within that subject area.

Found yourself a good research question? Awesome! The next part is **writing an introduction**, and if you followed my advice on picking a motivating topic, you're already prepared for this part. You should explain the goal of your investigation first of all, i.e. what you're trying to accomplish. *Why* are you doing your investigation? Put that here. And no, ""because the IB told me to"" or ""because I just needed to come up with a topic"" are not good rationales here. If that's the best you can come up with, you might want to consider finding a better topic. Physics covers a wide range of topics, so you should be able to come up with something that interests you. It might take some time, but it's time well spent. (Make sure you do this early, though. If your deadline is tomorrow, then first of all, don't procrastinate on your *next* IA. You *must* have adequate time left to do your actual investigation and writing the IA *at a comfortable pace*.)

Do back up your topic with background information in your introduction, if you have any. I referred to studies showing the optimal temperature to drink hot beverages. But make sure that the background information is relevant, and connect it to your investigation later. Whatever you put there should be there for a reason. Also state your real-world situation here. Bonus points if you can connect this to the background information as well.

Once you feel satisfied with your introduction, go ahead and tick off the following boxes on the requirements list, and put them on your IA:

- **Research question.** The one single concise question or sentence that your entire investigation is based on. You can put this *after* the introduction so that you can use the introduction to build up a foundation for the RQ. You should have already explained the goal of the investigation in the introduction anyway. Put the RQ in there as a way to define the scope of your research.

- **Variables.** Independent, dependent, and controlled variables. You're trying to see how doing one thing differently changes the outcome/result. The thing you're doing differently is the independent variable and doesn't necessarily have to be numerical (I used different methods of stirring as my ind. variable), but it could be if you want to (e.g. drop height of a ball is a measurable variable).

While we're doing variables, it's best if you only have one independent variable. That makes things a lot easier for you. A couple other things about variables:

- State your dependent variable. If it's not immediately clear how you'll be measuring this variable, make sure to put a note on how you plan to do so.

- Controlled variables are anything that can affect your experiment's outcome, that you don't change. (If you think about it, your independent variable is just a controlled variable that you decided to change.) What this is depends a lot on the type of experiment you're doing. If you're doing something in thermal physics, ambient temperature is pretty much certainly a controlled variable. As another example, if you're doing a bouncing ball experiment, the ball itself is very likely a controlled variable, whereas in friction experiments, the coefficient of friction of one or both surfaces may be controlled variables.

- If your independent variable is not a numerical value, it might be a good idea to outline the differences between each value, and if the ind. variable is a difference between methods, definitely outline how the method changes (e.g. look at how I explained my variable on page 2). **Explain what you think will happen** when you change the values of your independent variable.

**Materials and equipment** must be listed. You don't have to be all fancy with this; a bullet point list will do just fine. However, take special care that if you're using a measurement tool, such as a thermometer or cup, you ***MUST*** state the range and uncertainty of the tool. Otherwise, you **will lose marks**. Whoever reads your IA must gain enough information that he or she can replicate your experiment. If you used a measuring cup with a capacity of 50 ml, but don't state that value, whoever tries to replicate your experiment will scratch their heads when they try to use a 1 liter cup because they didn't know how big it was supposed to be.

Are there any **safety risks** associated with your experiment? In kinematics, there probably aren't (at least unless you're using very heavy objects and/or drop things from considerable heights). But in e.g. thermal physics, heat can be dangerous if high enough. If you used any sharp or pointy tools, such as a sharp knife, that could be a safety risk as well. Make sure that if you can identify any risks, you outline them, and also what you did to prevent injuries related to those risks. If there are no safety risks, you can either omit this section, or even better, put it there and just state that there were no known risks associated with the experiment.

## The actual science-y part

The procedure itself! You *can* probably choose to be super boring and just write a numbered list of things you did when you performed the experiment, but come on, you can do better than that. Imagine you're publishing this thing in a journal later. Nobody puts numbered steps in a journal. *Write!* You take English as one of your IB subjects so I know you can do this. Be detailed, and structure in a clear way.

- Write in **past tense**. You're writing a report, not an instruction manual.
- Be **objective** and **avoid personal references** (i.e. don't say ""I filled the cup with water,"" but rather, ""The cup was filled with water."")
- Don't be overly repetitive. Vary your language to make it more exciting to read.
- Be detailed. Someone reading your report with no other information about the experiment should be able to replicate what you did.

As for actually *performing* the experiment, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- Have enough values for your independent variable. Try and aim for at least five. E.g. five different temperatures, five different altitudes, five different whatever your independent variable (IV) is.
- Do enough trials. At least five for each value of your IV. Our teacher pushed us to do 15 trials. You don't necessarily have to do 15, but the more you do, the more likely you are to eliminate random errors in your results.

Don't discard any data you collect unless something goes horribly wrong during the trial, or previous data was accidentally lost. If you topple something by accident in a way that makes you have to abort the trial very early, then you can run a new trial to make sure you have enough data. It might be a good idea to make a note about what happened in the report and how you chose to deal with it. If your hard drive crashed causing you to lose your data, then you'll have to collect new data as well. (But please do back your data up. Put it on a memory stick, in the cloud, or email it to yourself. It saves you a lot of pain.)

If you omit data without a good justification for doing so, it may be seen as cherry picking, which is a form of selection bias and confirmation bias. **This is actually very serious. Don't do this.** It's okay if the data didn't align with your expectations for your experiment. You can discuss why in your analysis section and be just fine. The IB isn't evaluating whether your results were what you anticipated them to be. They're evaluating how you performed your experiment and how you handle the results that the experiment provided. Also, never, *ever*, fabricate data.

**Cherry picking and fabrication of data are forms of academic dishonesty. If you do this, and you're caught (and trust me, you *will* be caught - examiners are smarter than you think!), you may risk FAILING YOUR ENTIRE DIPLOMA. Just don't. It isn't worth it.**

## Results

You're finally done with your experiment! Now you can relax and have fun. Seriously, go take a break. You did a lot of work already, so if you have time for it, relax for a bit. You still have some work to do, but it's mostly theoretical from now on. You're no longer dependent on keeping your controls unchanged, since all the data is safely stored.

Ok, on to the results. You have to put your raw data onto the report, and no, you can't tuck it away in an appendix to dodge the 12 page limit. If you have a *lot* of data because you used a digital data logger like Logger Pro/Vernier sensors, like I did, then be sensible and cut down on what you put on the report. In my own experiment, I did 15 trials across 6 IV variations and for each of those, I collected one data point per half second for 10 minutes. *That's over 100,000 unique data points.* Yet, my report only contains 180 of them. Why? I averaged all the trials and only listed data points from every 20 seconds instead of every 0.5 seconds. My supervisor had no problem with this at all. (For my chemistry IA, I didn't do this, and initially ended up with 11 pages of raw data. It did *not* end well.)

Of course, if you *don't* have pages upon pages of data, then just list all of it. Only cut down on the data if you have excessive amounts of it. If you record data by hand, like a lot of IB students, then I don't see how this could ever realistically become a problem for you. The bottom line is, **include a sensible amount of raw data in your report**. Aim for one page or less.

Make sure that you state uncertainties in your data. If you don't do this, you'll lose marks. Don't put the uncertainty behind every single data value in your data table. Put it in the column header instead. That way, the table looks cleaner.

**Visualize your data.** How you do this really depends on the type of data you have collected, but chances are that the best way to present your data is through an X/Y scatter plot. Either way, here are some tips:

- Try not to take a screenshot of the chart you made in Excel and paste that into Word, if you can avoid it. Just copy the entire chart over directly, if you know how to do it. It probably won't cost you marks if you don't do it, but it'll print much better, and also drastically cut the file size of your submission. IIRC there is a 10 MB limit for digital submissions. Don't go over that limit.

- Use error bars. If you're not sure how to add those, do a Google search for it. [Here's the procedure for Excel 2007-2016.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-change-or-remove-error-bars-in-a-chart-e6d12c87-8533-4cd6-a3f5-864049a145f0)

- Make sure to clearly label the chart, and add uncertainties.

After you have *stated* the data, you'll have to **analyze it**. I can't tell you how to do that specifically, since it really depends on what your procedure, data, and research question is. Look for models in physics that can explain your findings and that relate to the topic you're investigating. State formulae, and use them. Also provide at least one sample calculation using each formula. This is to prove that you understand how the formula is used. Pick one data point and run the numbers through the formula.

- Excel helps a lot. Learn how to process data in Excel. Don't use a calculator. Excel does everything a calculator does and much more, and also much faster.

- Charting your processed data may also be a good idea, depending on what your desired outcome is.

- Is something wrong? Adapt your analysis and try to explain what is wrong, and if your analysis doesn't work out the way you wanted, do a different approach. I tried to apply Newton's Law of Cooling to my processed data to find a cooling coefficient, only to find that that didn't work at all. So I changed it and used a reciprocal model instead. Data fit almost perfectly.

- Make sure to mention experimental errors here if they affect how you perform your analysis.

## The final part

By now you'll have analyzed your experimental data and you're left with a result. Was it what you anticipated? Was it not? Did anything go wrong during the experiment itself? This is where you'll be detailing that, because now it's **conclusion time**.

The conclusion of your report is the final part of your report, it's a summary of what you figured out. Don't go into huge detail about the goal of your experiment here, because that part is already written way up in the introduction.

State the answer to your research question, first and foremost. Once that's done, you can elaborate on the results of your experiment vs. your initial expectations of what would happen. That's what the conclusion is for.

**State error sources.** Don't forget about this. For every error source, you must:

- State the error
- State what kind of error it is (systematic or random)
- Explain what effect the error had on the data/results
- Unless it's immediately obvious, also explain how the error could have been avoided and *if* it should be avoided (chances are that it should be, but if it for some reason shouldn't, specify why avoiding it would be detrimental to the results)

Finally, at the very *end* of your report, cite your sources if you used any. You probably did. Put them here. Use a recognized citation style. A lot of schools love MLA. I used APA. If your supervisor tells you to use a specific style, then do that.

## Formatting

Oh, you thought we were done? Not quite! But I promise, we're almost there. The only thing left I want to discuss is usage of formal elements. You are still doing IB English, so there are no excuses for not doing it. Here's a checklist:

- **Use page numbers.** I did ""Page X of Y"" centered in the footer of each page. How you do it is up to you. There's a function in Word that does this for you automatically. [Here's how.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-page-numbers-in-Word-9f366518-0500-4b45-903d-987d3827c007)

- **Use a legible font.** If you even so much as consider using Comic Sans for your paper then I won't feel sorry for you if you get a poor grade. Good choices are Times New Roman, Arial, Verdana, etc. I used Crimson Text in mine. Anything that would be considered appropriate in an academic journal is 100% fine.

- **Use headings.** Word has a nice function to automatically style headings with the click of a button. If you can't figure it out, just write your heading, make it bold, and increase the font size a few notches. Use a title too, on the first page. A cover page shouldn't be necessary.

- **Put *something* in the header** on each page. Preferably the title of your investigation. Don't make it too long. I just followed a simple template of ""Physics IA: <my topic here>"". This happens to be my title, too.

- **Don't put your name or candidate number anywhere.** All submissions should be anonymous.

- **Use 1.5 line spacing.** This really improves readability. Don't try and get away with too much line spacing to artificially inflate your page count. The same goes for font size.

- **Listen to your English teacher.** I know this is physics, but your report is a written piece of work. Listen to your physics teacher too, of course, but know that formatting makes a difference.

## TL;DR checklist

- You're a high school student, not a PhD graduate. Keep your topic at a sensible level of difficulty.

I [previously made an analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/5tlheu/lured_three_pok%C3%A9stops_for_six_hours_in_a/) of spawn rates from lures, and I'm back again now to see what the spawning patterns are like during the current worldwide bloom event.

# Location details

If you're interested in historical info about the location, then feel free to check out the old post. The important things are; this analysis was done on a triple lure over the course of six hours, the surrounding area is tagged as a naval base on OpenStreetMap (something I was previously unaware of), hence all normal spawns are suppressed in a ~200 m radius with few exceptions, and when lured previously, there has been a tendency for the lures to sometimes spawn large amounts of Voltorbs and Magnemites.

Suspected biome for the area is primarily water with a hint of Forest, but with a very rich and diverse mix of non-water spawns, and a possible, unidentified electric biome *somewhere* nearby, though I'm not quite sure where.

# Pokéstops

[These are the Pokéstops I lured](https://i.imgur.com/wzihSSb.jpg) (this is an old picture from February, there is no snow there at this point). I will refer to the Pokéstops by name from here on:

- The Pokéstop on the left side of the canal is **North**
- The Pokéstop right next to the lamp post on the right is **Middle**
- The Pokéstop in the background, in front of the yellow building is **South**

# Methodology

Equipped with my phone, a solar panel, and some food, I went down to the area and placed three lures at 11:09 AM local time (CEST timezone; 9:09 AM UTC). I claimed my 7-day Pokéstop streak on the North Pokéstop (got a Dragon Scale, yay!) and sat down on a bench on the right side of the canal to start catching things that spawned.

Every spawn was scanned and logged by Calcy IV upon catching the Pokémon. (In my last analysis I kept a tally by hand, but I figured I would save a lot of time using an app. Plus it would also save the timestamp of the catch, as well as CP, HP and other parameters in case those could be useful.) The Pokémon were always caught in the order North-South-Middle, so that I could easily assign each Pokémon to which Pokéstop it spawned on when I analyzed the data. (This was a shortcoming that was pointed out to me in the last analysis, thanks /u/element3501!)

For Pokémon that ran away, I logged the CP and spawning time manually in a notepad app. I also logged critical catches in the notepad.

When the lures expired at 5:09 PM CEST, I exported my Calcy history to CSV, went home, and transferred my notes and history to my computer. I filtered out all catches prior to the lure placement, added fleeing Pokémon, added critical catch data, and assigned every spawn to the correct Pokéstop. I found that there were actually several spawns that Calcy had not logged data for, and after recovering what I could from my journal, I ended up with data for 357 out of 360 Pokémon, or 99.2% of all spawns. I then created a frequency table of Pokémon types, and added together the number of spawns for each type of Pokémon. (This was >357 because several Pokémon have dual typing.) I then charted the results.

# Spawn results

A total of 357 spawns were logged, covering 68 unique species of Pokémon. (Pokémon of the same family, such as Victreebel and Weepinbell, are considered unique species in this count.)

The South Pokéstop unfortunately managed to get afflicted by Voltorb-Magnemitis, and spawned almost exclusively Voltorbs and Magnemites for the entirety of the six hours of lures. This messed up my data a bit, so I've chosen to declare all spawns on that Pokéstop as anomalies, and will ignore it for the rest of my analysis.

## Charts

You can really see how the South Pokéstop would cause an issue.

## Discussion

Looking at the numbers, it's clear that Grass Pokémon made up the majority of spawns. When I was sitting there, it certainly did not seem that way. It turns out that more Pokémon are grass types than I expected. Grass was followed by Poison, which was almost tied with Water. Keep in mind that normally, grass types are not usually as common as water here. The grass types most common outside of events here are Bellsprout, Paras and Hoppip. Sunkern, Exeggcute and Oddish also spawn, although rarer than the aforementioned ones, and Chikorita, Bulbasaur and Skiploom are rare. The remaining grass types are very rare, with Tangela taking the prize as the rarest grass spawn in the area, spawning less frequently than even Chansey does.

It might also be interesting to see the distribution of grass type Pokémon for each Pokéstop:

[Both **North** and **Middle** Pokéstop](https://i.imgur.com/j7HdUFa.png)

[The **North** Pokéstop only](https://i.imgur.com/lmRCvAO.png)

[The **Middle** Pokéstop only](https://i.imgur.com/SwGlkas.png)

---

Paras (11), Bellsprout (9), Exeggcute (9) and Oddish (9) make up the majority of the grass spawns, followed by Chikorita (8), Hoppip (7) and Sunkern (6). Skiploom (2) and Weepinbell (2) were the only evolved Grass forms and make up for the bottom two species on the spawn rate chart. No other grass types spawned during the six hours, and no grass types spawned whatsoever on the South Pokéstop.

# Other data

- Out of 357 logged spawns, 348 Pokémon were caught and 9 ran away.
- Out of 348 caught Pokémon, 5 were caught with a critical catch.

# Error sources

- The Voltorb-Magnemitis infection meant that I could only use data from two Pokéstops, hence 33% of potential data was lost. This should not affect the accuracy of the valid data, but the values would have been more refined if this Pokéstop could also have been used.
- Three spawns were lost. Apparently Calcy didn't log them. Those three spawns made up for less than 1% of the spawns, though, so there shouldn't have been much effect from this in the data.
- Calcy misinterpreted some CP values (e.g. it read CP 602 when the Pokémon in reality was CP 607). This has not been corrected, but it shouldn't affect the above analysis either way because CP values were not taken into consideration in the analysis.

# Raw data

Download here (OpenDocument format): http://puu.sh/vHK8z/138ef8fbfb.ods

I am level 34, so the wild Pokémon spawns ranged from level 1 to level 30.

# Conclusions

- The event makes grass types spawn much more frequently
- No noteworthy rares spawned this time, the rarest spawn being a Sandslash

Also:

- I really hate Magnemite's movement patterns
- Voltorbs are extremely aggressive
- Nanab berries are useful for catching Voltorbs
- I almost ran out of balls despite starting with over 100 of each and sitting on three Pokéstops

Here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

Edit: You can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

This works because the Fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618). The ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or very, very close to the golden ratio.

There is a region near me that does not spawn any Pokémon whatsoever in the wild, but that also contains a lot of Pokéstops. It also happens to contain two of the three triple lure spots in a range of *at least* 20 miles meaning it has been a very popular place for people to gather and catch Pokémon. In the summer, before the new tracker was introduced, you could stand at one of those triple lure spots for hours without ever seeing anything appear on Nearby, despite being only 250 m from the city centre (which had lots of wild spawns). The area used to be a naval base since the 1750's, and the last military establishments were moved away in 2002. It is now a historical site with many very old buildings and objects, which is why there are so many Pokéstops there. The no-spawning zone which encompasses the area follows the site's boundaries (a wall and/or moat) almost exactly.

After new spawning points were added to the game, two spots immediately next to each other have started spawning Pokémon very close to one of the triple lure spots. Both of the spots are in the sea, and technically outside of the historical area, but one of them are just close enough for it to show up on Nearby at one of the Pokéstops forming the triple lure. [This screenshot shows a Magikarp spawning at the spawn point that isn't in range of the Pokéstop](https://i.imgur.com/ZvdmiHo.png). There is also a third added spawn point, on a beach about 10 meters outside of the area's boundaries.

# The Pokéstops

[Here is the triple lure I chose](https://i.imgur.com/wzihSSb.jpg) and [this is how it looks in Pokémon Go](https://i.imgur.com/lecBNxE.png). Historically, these three stops have spawned a large variety of Pokémon, and occasionally, they would only spawn Magnemite, Voltorb, Magneton and Electrode. I'm not sure if the biome that the stops are in has changed, but they seem to spawn a significantly larger amount of water Pokémon now.

# Experiment

I came up with the idea on Friday, and decided to wake up early today to place the lures. I settled down, and placed the lures at 6:30. I then noted down every spawn in a notepad app.

I got [a few rares to show up](https://imgur.com/a/v8zpN), including one Porygon and one Flareon, which was pretty exciting. All of the starters also showed up at least once, except for Bulbasaur. I didn't catch every Pokémon, but caught all of those that could be a Ditto and those that I was interested in. There were no Dittos, and a surprisingly small number of otherwise common Pokémon like Pidgey. In total I caught 58 different species, of which 7 were 2nd evolution ones. There were no 3rd evolution Pokémon sighted.

If you've got any questions, feel free to ask!

It will be stored off-site at a friend's place, most likely.

How should I store the drive, and how should I set it up? Should it be stored directly in an antistatic bag? Can I put it in an antistatic bag, wrap it in some cloth or soft material and place the whole bundle in a tupperware box, or can this damage the drive? What kind of file system should I put on it?

It's the best I've ever had. Now, I've got a problem. Recently, my phone has started acting out. This means, for instance, getting stuck on ""Loading"" and ""Resuming"" on everything, including the start menu, and my phone even reset itself once. Worse than a soft reset, but not quite a hard reset - I got an error that something had happened and that Windows had ""tried to recover"" when turning the phone on, but that I would have to rearrange my start screen again because my tiles were probably mixed up. All apps were there, but contacts had to re-sync and Photos wouldn't find photos that were actually present on the device.

Now, my phone has hard bricked itself - as in, [unable to find a bootable option](https://i.imgur.com/1AKEDTj.jpg) indicating some sort of hardware fault. The same fate happened to another 1020 in our household just a few months earlier, and neither WDRT nor NSRT will recognize either device. The USB port is also broken on this one - it barely charges (much slower than it should be), and computers either won't recognize the device at all, or it won't sustain a connection for longer than a minute, or file transfers from it freeze randomly.

Since the USB port broke, I used a [very handy app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/easy-transfer/9wzdncrfhzq8) to back up my photos over Wi-Fi, and once my device started acting out, I immediately turned on OneDrive syncing for photos and videos so I wouldn't lose anything. It worked - to an extent. I have all of my photos stored there, except a couple dozen that apparently wouldn't sync. Now, it's only maybe a couple dozen photos that are missing, but it would be very nice if I could recover those somehow. They're from a reunion, and are kind of hard to recreate. I know they're still stored on the storage device, but I can't get them out since the phone won't turn on or restore. (A restore would probably wipe those photos, too.) Has anyone had any luck fixing this kind of error, or extracting the storage chip from the phone and connecting it to a computer, somehow?

You decide for yourself if you want to read through the whole thing; nobody is forcing you to - but it would give you the best insight into a trend that is starting to raise red flags. It's about the community, and Minecraft as we know it today.

First, let me start off with an introduction of Curse. Curse, Inc. is a technology company specializing in making products targeted at gamers. They run a large number of forums and wikis, and is ubiquitous in several large gaming communities today, including Minecraft. Curse has done a lot of good things to the Minecraft community, such as giving revenue to modders, centralizing mods in a single place, and helping modpack creators out with easy creation of modpacks (like mod licensing). They have been a good driving force behind the community, and has helped us get to where we are today.

However, there is a very worrying trend with Curse that does not quite receive the attention that it deserves. A [post](/r/feedthebeast/comments/4l17qa/jaded_and_myrathi_fired_from_curse/) in /r/feedthebeast is what prompted me to write this thread. There trend is the centralization that Curse provides to Minecraft communities. I'll try and break it up into individual points.

## Ownership

### Minecraft

Minecraft started out as an indie game by Markus Persson, aka. Notch. Notch started Mojang AB, and the company hired more developers. The game just kept growing, and eventually partnered with 4J Studios to provide console versions of the game, and Mojang was bought by Microsoft. Mojang is still largely in control of the game, but Microsoft is the company that ultimately owns it. (As pointed out by /u/jurarajupiter, Mojang is still 100% Mojang and they control the game, and Microsoft's involvement has not changed that. Mojang is, as a company, owned by Microsoft, but this has not affected the company in any way.)

### The wiki

A wiki was set up to manage community information about the game. ~~I don't know exactly by whom it was set up.~~ The wiki was founded by citricsquid in 2009 and then hosted by Curse since 2010. (Thanks for finding this, /u/mynameisperl.) It serves as the community's main source of information on the game, and presents an easy way for beginners to get acquainted with its quirks and mechanics.

### The forums

A forum was created by citricsquid in 2009. It served as the first community Minecraft forum, and was acquired by Curse in late 2010. It is the biggest Minecraft forum in existence today.

### Modding

Many players argue that without mods, there is no way that Minecraft would have survived for as long as it has. Mods add unique gameplay features to Minecraft, and help make the game a whole lot more interesting, if you ever get bored of the vanilla game. Mods were (and still are) primarily advertised and distributed on the Minecraft Forums. Curse came along with CurseForge, which allowed modders to host their mods in a simple, central place, earning some revenue (author reward points) along with it.

### Modpacks

Players got creative and started putting mods together into packs for people to play with. Modpacks are distributed by many entities, but the two biggest are the Technic Platform and Feed The Beast. Curse ~~bought~~ partnered with FTB and [attempted to buy Technic](https://i.imgur.com/p3zPOIl.png) as well.

### Others

Couple this with texture-packs and world downloads, and it becomes clear that Curse has a pretty established foothold in the Minecraft community. Planet Minecraft are also pretty big on the latter two aspects of the game. /r/Minecraft is moderated by the community.

### TL;DR

Platform | Major providers
--- | ---
Minecraft | Mojang
Forums | Curse
Wiki | Curse
Mod hosting | Curse
Modpacks | FTB (Curse partner) and Technic
Texture packs | Curse and Planet Minecraft
Community worlds | Curse and Planet Minecraft
Reddit presence | Community moderated

## The problem

As you can probably see from the table above, a very, very large part of the community is based around the services provided by a single company. In cases where multiple providers compete, Curse has a significant share of content. *This* is the trend that worries me. **Due to the current distribution of Minecraft community content, I argue that Curse has a dangerous high impact on the community of Minecraft.** I say this since while the game itself is owned by Mojang (Microsoft), the services that the community relies on are almost all platforms owned by Curse.

So why do I post about this now? I introduced this post with a link to a post in /r/feedthebeast. [Here's the link again.](/r/feedthebeast/comments/4l17qa/jaded_and_myrathi_fired_from_curse/) The post is about recent moves made by Curse in relation to high-profile members of the Minecraft community. For the uninitiated, [Jadedcat](https://twitter.com/JadedcatWylde/status/735524306260623361), [Myriathi](https://twitter.com/Myrathi/status/735540615925145600) and [Eyamaz](https://twitter.com/Eyamaz/status/735552519028539392) were unexpectedly and suddenly let go from Curse a few days ago. This is not a good sign. To quote /u/SynfulChaot from that thread;

> This may just be that significant thing, Fyber.  If they're willing to abandon such prominent and active people as Jaded and Eyamaz ***without warning***, then that doesn't bode well for ***anyone***.

Curse has been involved in a few [practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/23cf60/blizzard_game_subreddits_are_run_by_curse_network/) to promote their own content. This thread was also [discussed in /r/feedthebeast](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/23ct4n/); I encourage you to read some oft he comments in that discussion, as it highlights issues with the community monopolization that Curse is attempting.

So why were they laid off? /u/DZCreeper has a theory:

> When Curse first started edging themselves into the modded MC community there were warnings. Some have sailed the deep and salty waters before but ironically the 'veterans' ignored the warnings. Now that they have a firm toehold some of the more elite members of the community are useless to Curse.

> As a company they exist solely to make money and have zero moral issue with revamping and potentially destroying an entire community to do so. Saying 'I told you so!' is immature but I have the urge to jump on the nearest fence and holler it.

/u/DZCreeper makes a very valid point about how companies are run. They cannot operate without profit, and the community itself does not matter in those decisions. To highlight this, when Slowpoke commented about the situation in the FTB thread, he [cared more about the FTB-Curse relationship](https://np.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/4l17qa/jaded_and_myrathi_fired_from_curse/d3jpwwz) than he did about the community. Ask yourself this question: Who really cares about the FTB-Curse relationship? Do *you* care about it? This is corporate-level PR speak.

## ""So what?""

This might not seem like a very big issue now, but it has a very large potential impact. If the Minecraft community turns out to not be profitable for Curse, they will implement changes to monetize their platforms that we won't like. What about membership fees on the forums or CurseForge? They may fire more prominent community members, or, in the absolute worst case scenario, pull the plug on the entire project. This is very unlikely to happen in the short term, mind you, but we can't forget it as a far-future possibility. Don't trick yourself into thinking that Curse will always care about the Minecraft community. Changes like those have happened on many other sites before, and they're bound to happen again. It's all about the money.

This post is mostly to serve as a warning about the direction we're heading in. If you read through it all, thank you for doing that. I appreciate it. If not, I'll TL;DR for you below. Either way, we need to be aware of what can happen if Curse decides to change their platforms. There are many smaller providers of similar services out there, such as mods.io, which attempt to serve as an alternative to the Curse establishment. Not all succeed, such as the Creepr forums as forum.creepr.org, which drowned as it never got enough traction. However, we must be prepared in case something happens. Again, Curse has been a big help for us so far, but **we can't rely on a single point of failure.**

Finally, quoting /u/Draakon0,

>>It's a central source

>While great in its own way (you need to go trough 1 launcher to get everything), its also very bad. There need's to be different sources with different policies and rules, to make sure there is competition AND everybody can play and mod that suites their needs. Take even Nexus as an example before Skyrim got Workshop integration. It is a great site with great tools, but some of the content from there is banned. If Nexus was the only modding site only available, some of the mods outside Nexus wouldn't even exist.

>Keeping all the eggs in one basket is bad.

TL;DR: We all rely upon the goodwill of a single company, a company which cares more about profit than community, for almost all of our community creations. As it currently stands, Curse is in a position of so much power that this fact should be of much greater concern than it currently is.",I'm worried about current trends in the Minecraft community.

Having quite a large fan base on Reddit, this is naturally posted to various subreddits, one of which is /r/videos. [This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kx2x1/were_being_sued/) was posted to /r/videos at 2:48 AM GMT by a Reddit user. Many argue that the lawsuit stands no chance and that it is meant as an attack on h3h3's criticism. Ethan faces potentially up to $100k in legal fees and a 2 year long trial.

The post is then [deleted](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kx2x1/were_being_sued/d3ii65c), but it resurfaces and it turns out that the post was removed due to AutoModerator having h3h3 on the spam filter.

However, from here, things change. The post is suddenly [deleted again](https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/735360889805799424) ^[\[a\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20160525124454/https:/twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/735360889805799424) - and this time, the 5-year-old account ([archive](https://archive.is/HqHBR)) which posted it disappears with it. The video is [re-submitted by another user](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kyeqg/resubmission_were_being_sued_h3h3productions/), and /r/videos' redditors start questioning why the video was removed, users speculating that OP might have been [threatened into submission](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kyeqg/resubmission_were_being_sued_h3h3productions/d3iu93g?context=10000).

The OP of the new post then receives an [11 BTC / 5000 USD offer](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kyeqg/resubmission_were_being_sued_h3h3productions/d3issta) to remove the post. Speculations begin that this might be Bold Guy (the guy who sued Ethan). Mods chime in and say that [they had nothing to do](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kyeqg/resubmission_were_being_sued_h3h3productions/d3it6il?context=3) with the removal of the previous post.

A few hours later, the offer is proven fake. The person who sent the offer then [appears in that thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kyeqg/resubmission_were_being_sued_h3h3productions/d3ixt9i?context=2), where he claimed that OP [threatened to kill him and his family](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4kyeqg/resubmission_were_being_sued_h3h3productions/d3iy2cx).
